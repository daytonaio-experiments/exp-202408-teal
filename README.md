## Development Container Constructor

**Job to be Done:**

**When** an end user wants to quickly set up a development environment for any chosen Git repository,

**I want** to create a command `daytona create --ai-plugin="set me up with a [project type] project"` that triggers an AI/LLM pipeline to automatically detect relevant entities (e.g., GitHub project repository),

**So that** the user can seamlessly set up a development environment without manually searching for information or configuring files, saving time and reducing setup complexity.

### Objectives
1. **Command Execution:** Enable users to invoke a command that triggers an AI-powered setup process for any selected Git repository.
2. **Entity Detection:** Use OpenAI API to identify relevant entities from the user's input.
3. **Information Retrieval:** Search GitHub repositories and extract relevant information like README.md.
4. **Context Analysis:** Analyze the gathered context to understand the project requirements.
5. **Artifact Generation:** Generate a `devcontainer.json` file based on the analyzed context.

### High-Level Functional Specification for Development Container Constructor

#### Overview
This document outlines the functional specification for the Development Container Constructor, an AI-powered feature in the Daytona project that allows users to set up development environments for any selected Git repository with a simple command. The system employs an AI/LLM pipeline to analyze user requests, retrieve relevant information from GitHub, and auto-generate necessary configuration files like `devcontainer.json`.

#### Functional Requirements

**1. Command Execution**
*NOTE:* We can mock this part and leave the integration into daytona CLI to the engineering team.
- **User Command:**
  - Users can execute a command like `daytona create --ai-plugin="set me up with a [project type] project"`.
- **Command Parser:**
  - The command parser should validate and parse the input to extract the `--ai-plugin` parameter.

**2. Entity Detection**
- **OpenAI API Integration:**
  - The system should call the OpenAI API (ideally we can use standardized API calls to have flexibility to change providers at any moment, or even use local LLM, e.g. Ollama with Codellama or similar, this needs testing and research) to analyze the command text and identify relevant entities, such as GitHub repositories for the specified project type.
- **Entity Extraction:**
  - Extract entities like project names, repository URLs, libraries, and other relevant keywords from the user's input.

**3. Information Retrieval**
- **GitHub API Search:**
  - Use the GitHub API to search for the extracted entities corresponding to the user's specified project type.
  - Identify and retrieve files like `README.md` and other relevant (or linked, e.g. docs.project.com) documentation from the matched repositories.
- **Content Gathering:**
  - Collect comprehensive context about the project, including dependencies, setup instructions, and configurations from the retrieved files.

**4. Context Analysis**
- **Content Analysis:**
  - Analyze the gathered context to extract key information on dependencies, development environment requirements, and setup instructions.
- **Data Structuring:**
  - Structure the analyzed information into a standardized format that can be used to generate configuration files.

**5. Artifact Generation**
- **Devcontainer Specification:**
  - Use the structured context and dev container specifications to create a `devcontainer.json` file.
  - We could segment this into several functions to match the dev container spec (e.g. features, extensions, commands, etc.)
- **Output Formatting:**
  - Ensure the generated `devcontainer.json` file and any other relevant configuration files (this is optional, but for example, Dockerfile, requirements.txt) are correctly formatted and syntactically valid.
- **File Generation:**
  - Save the generated configuration files in the user's project directory.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:**
  - The system should handle multiple sizes or complexities of the inputs (several repos, big repos, etc.).
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize the entity detection and context analysis processes for speed to provide quick feedback to the user. Keep user informed on what is happening, especially if it takes time.
- **Usability:**
  - Ensure the command and resulting setup are user-friendly and can integrate seamlessly into the current Daytona project workflow.
- **Reliability:**
  - Ensure high accuracy in entity detection and context analysis to generate correct and useful configuration files.

#### Deployment and Integration (NOT MANDATORY)
- **Integration:**
  - Seamlessly integrate the AI/LLM pipeline with the Daytona project command-line interface (CLI).
- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the solution within the existing infrastructure, supporting both cloud-based and local environments.

#### Future Enhancements
- **Interactive Customization:**
  - Allow users to interactively confirm or customize the detected entities and gathered context before generating the configuration files.
- **Continuous Learning:**
  - Track and log user interactions for future improvements.
