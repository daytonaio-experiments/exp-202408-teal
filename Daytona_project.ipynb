Routing is the ability to navigate from one component in the application to another. In [Single Page Applications (SPA)](guide/routing), only parts of the page are updated to represent the requested view for the user.\\n\\nThe [Angular Router](guide/routing) enables users to declare routes and specify which component should be displayed on the screen if that route is requested by the application.\\n\\nIn this lesson, you will enable routing in your application to navigate to the details page.\\n\\n<docs-workflow>\\n\\n<docs-step title=\"Create a default details component \">\\n1.

In the `src/app` directory, create a file called `routes.ts`. This file is where we will define the routes in the application.\\n\\n1. In `main.ts`, make the following updates to enable routing in the application:\\n    1. Import the routes file and the `provideRouter` function:\\n\\n        <docs-code header=\"Import routing details in src/main.ts\" path=\"adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/11-details-page/src/main.ts\" visibleLines=\"[7,8]\"/>\\n\\n    1.

In the `template` property, replace the `<app-home></app-home>` tag with the `<router-outlet>` directive and add a link back to the home page. Your code should match this code:\\n\\n        <docs-code header=\"Add router-outlet in src/app/app.component.ts\" path=\"adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/11-details-page/src/app/app.component.ts\" visibleLines=\"[8,18]\"/>\\n\\n</docs-step>\\n\\n<docs-step title=\"Add route to new component\">\\nIn the previous step you removed the reference to the `<app-home>` component in the template. In this step, you will add a new route to that component.\\n\\n1. In `routes.ts`, perform the following updates to create a route.\\n    1. Add a file level imports for the `HomeComponent`, `DetailsComponent` and the `Routes` type that you\\'ll use in the route definitions.\\n\\n        <docs-code header=\"Import components and Routes\" path=\"adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/11-details-page/src/app/routes.ts\" visibleLines=\"[1,3]\"/>\\n\\n    1.

In `src/app/details/details.component.ts` update the template to import the functions, classes and services that you\\'ll need to use in the `DetailsComponent`:\\n\\n    <docs-code header=\"Update file level imports\" path=\"adev/src/content/tutorials/first-app/steps/12-forms/src/app/details/details.component.ts\" visibleLines=\"[1,5]\"/>\\n\\n1.

In the `constructor`, the code converts the `id` parameter acquired from the route from a string to a number.\\n\\n1. Save all changes.\\n\\n1. In the browser, click on one of the housing location\\'s \"Learn More\" links and confirm that the numeric value displayed on the page matches the `id` property for that location in the data.\\n</docs-step>\\n\\n<docs-step title=\"Customize the `DetailComponent`\">\\nNow that routing is working properly in the application this is a great time to update the template of the `DetailsComponent` to display the specific data represented by the housing location for the route parameter.\\n\\nTo access the data you will add a call to the `HousingService`.\\n\\n1.

In this activity, you\\'ll learn how to use `NgOptimizedImage` to ensure your images are loaded efficiently.\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<docs-workflow>\\n\\n<docs-step title=\"Import the NgOptimizedImage directive\">\\n\\nIn order to leverage the `NgOptimizedImage` directive, first import it from the `@angular/common` library and add it to the component `imports` array.\\n\\n```ts\\nimport { NgOptimizedImage } from \\'@angular/common\\';\\n\\n@Component({\\n  standalone: true,\\n  imports: [NgOptimizedImage],\\n  ...\\n})\\n```\\n\\n</docs-step>\\n\\n<docs-step title=\"Update the src attribute to be ngSrc\">\\n\\nTo enable the `NgOptimizedImage` directive, swap out the `src` attribute for `ngSrc`. This applies for both static image sources (i.e., `src`) and dynamic image sources (i.e., `[src]`).\\n\\n<docs-code language=\"ts\" highlight=\"[[9], [13]]\">\\nimport { NgOptimizedImage } from \\'@angular/common\\';\\n\\n@Component({\\n  standalone: true,\\n  template: `\\n    ...\\n    <li>\\n      Static Image:\\n      <img ngSrc=\"/assets/logo.svg\" alt=\"Angular logo\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" />\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n      Dynamic Image:\\n      <img [ngSrc]=\"logoUrl\" [alt]=\"logoAlt\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" />\\n    </li>\\n    ...\\n  `,\\n  imports: [NgOptimizedImage],\\n})\\n</docs-code>\\n\\n</docs-step>\\n\\n<docs-step title=\"Add width and height attributes\">\\n\\nNote that in the above code example, each image has both `width` and `height` attributes. In order to prevent [layout shift](https://web.dev/articles/cls), the `NgOptimizedImage` directive requires both size attributes on each image.\\n\\nIn situations where you can\\'t or don\\'t want to specify a static `height` and `width` for images, you can use [the `fill` attribute](https://web.dev/articles/cls) to tell the image to act like a \"background image\", filling its containing element:\\n\\n```ts\\n<div class=\"image-container\"> //Container div has \\'position: \"relative\"\\'\\n  <img ngSrc=\"www.example.com/image.png\" fill />\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nNote: For the `fill` image to render properly, its parent element must be styled with `position: \"relative\"`, `position: \"fixed\"`, or `position: \"absolute\"`.\\n\\n</docs-step>\\n\\n<docs-step title=\"Prioritize important images\">\\n\\nOne of the most important optimizations for loading performance is to prioritize any image which might be the [\"LCP element\"](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-lcp), which is the largest on-screen graphical element when the page loads. To optimize your loading times, make sure to add the `priority` attribute to your \"hero image\" or any other images that you think could be an LCP element.\\n\\n```ts\\n<img ngSrc=\"www.example.com/image.png\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" priority />\\n```\\n\\n</docs-step>\\n\\n<docs-step title=\"Optional: Use an image loader\">\\n\\n`NgOptimizedImage` allows you to specify an [image loader](guide/image-optimization#configuring-an-image-loader-for-ngoptimizedimage), which tells the directive how to format URLs for your images. Using a loader allows you to define your images with short, relative URLs:\\n\\n```ts\\nproviders: [\\n  provideImgixLoader(\\'https://my.base.url/\\'),\\n]\\n\\n// ...\\n// Final URL will be \\'https://my.base.url/image.png\\'\\n<img ngSrc=\"image.png\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" />\\n```\\n\\nImage loaders are for more than just convenience--they allow you to use the full capabilities of `NgOptimizedImage`. Learn more about these optimizations and the built-in loaders for popular CDNs [here](guide/image-optimization#configuring-an-image-loader-for-ngoptimizedimage).\\n\\n</docs-step>\\n\\n</docs-workflow>\\n\\nBy adding this directive to your workflow, your images are now loading using best practices with the help of Angular 🎉\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more, check out the [documentation for `NgOptimizedImage`](guide/image-optimization).

This approach is limited to time, and in some cases memory\\n(Chrome with special flags), as metric. It does not allow to measure:\\n\\n- rendering time: e.g. the time the browser spends to layout or paint elements. This can e.g. used to\\n  test the performance impact of stylesheet changes.\\n- garbage collection: e.g. how long the browser paused script execution, and how much memory was collected.\\n  This can be used to stabilize script execution time, as garbage collection times are usually very\\n  unpredictable. This data can also be used to measure and improve memory usage of applications,\\n  as the garbage collection amount directly affects garbage collection time.\\n- distinguish script execution time from waiting: e.g. to measure the client side only time that is spent\\n  in a complex user interaction, ignoring backend calls.\\n- measure fps to assert the smoothness of scrolling and animations.\\n\\nThis kind of data is already available in the DevTools of modern browsers. However, there is no standard way to\\nuse those tools in an automated way to measure web app performance, especially not across platforms.\\n\\nBenchpress tries to fill this gap, i.e. allow to access all kinds of performance metrics in an automated way.\\n\\n', 'How it works': '\\nBenchpress uses webdriver to read out the so-called \"performance log\" of browsers.

A default locale used within `@angular/core`. This is the `locale_en.ts` file.\\n2. Information about currencies with their symbols and fraction digits (based on the default locale). The base currency information resides in `@angular/common/src/i18n`.\\n3. Locale files containing date, plural, currency information and more.\\n\\nThis is a high-level overview of the tool and how it organizes/optimizes the locale data within Angular. In the following section the individual filesets are described in detail.\\n', 'Default locale file in `@angular/core`': '\\nThe default locale file resides within `@angular/core` and provides locale information for the `en` locale. The `en` locale is commonly used for local development. This default locale file does not differ from other locale files generated within `@angular/common/locales`, so the details are discussed below.\\n', 'Base currency information within `@angular/common`': \"\\nThe `@angular/core` package is not providing directives or syntax for dealing with currencies. This is part of the `@angular/common` package and its i18n features (such as the `currency` pipe). Due to this separation of concerns, the default locale in `core` does not contain any information about currencies, and the currency information is stored as a separate file within `@angular/common/src/i18n`.\\n\\nThe currency information is stored within an object that maps each currency code (like `USD`) to an array describing the symbol, narrow symbol and number of digits to display for fractions. e.g.\\n\\n```ts\\nconst baseCurrencies = {\\n  'CAD': ['CA$', '$', 2],\\n  'NZD': ['NZ$', '$'],\\n  'USD': ['$'],\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the snippet above, you might wonder why values for `NZD` or `USD` are missing. This is intentional as for `USD` there is no narrow symbol (given `$` already being the symbol). The tool does not set an explicit value for byte savings. Same applies for the fraction digits.\\n\", 'Locale files': \"\\nAside from the default locale (`en`) which is generated separately, this tool generates locale files for all other locales the CLDR package provides data for. Locale files currently provide the following locale data:\\n\\n* Date time settings (describes how dates are formatted, e.g. the locale-based label for Monday)\\n* Number settings (describing how numbers are formatted, e.g. what the plus symbol is)\\n* Currency settings (describing how to format currencies for current locale)\\n* Currency symbols based on the given locale. e.g. in `en-AU` `USD` is the currency symbol.\\n* Directionality of the locale (i.e. whether text is displayed in RTL or LTR)\\n\\nAll the data is stored in an array where the Angular framework can read specific data using the corresponding index (see `LocaleDataIndex` for details on how data is read).\\n\\n**Performance optimizations**\\n\\nGiven we already have currency symbols for the default locale within `@angular/common/src/i18n`, we do not need to capture currencies that aren't different within a given locale. We just omit the data for such currencies and let the Angular framework fall back to the currency symbols from the default locale (this avoids unnecessary duplication).\\n\\nAdditionally, if locale data is equal to locale data at a previous index, then the generation tool will not repeat the data but instead set `undefined`. The Angular framework will look for the previous value in that case. This reduces the payload size for locales even further. For example:\\n\\n```ts\\n[\\n  // ...\\n  labelsForDayPeriodsNarrow,\\n  labelsForDayPeriodsAbbreviated\\n]\\n```\\n\\nIf `labelsForDayPeriodsAbbreviated` for example is equal to `labelsForDayPeriodsNarrow`, then the tool will not set a value for the abbreviated labels. Instead, it will set `undefined` as that minifies to: `[labelsForDayPeriodsNarrow, undefined]`.\\n\\n\", 'Where are the CLDR data files stored?': '\\nThe CLDR data is fetched through Bazel repositories. See the project-level `WORKSPACE` file for more information. The generation tool resolves all locale data through the `@cldr_json_data` and `@cldr_xml_data` Bazel repositories (depending on the data format that it needs).\\n\\nLocale files, or the default currencies file are not source files that would end up in the Git repository. This is different to the old Gulp setup where such files were added as part of the repository. The benefit of no longer adding such files to the Git repository is that updating CLDR is no longer resulting in large diffs. Another significant benefit is that files cannot be modified manually. Previously, developers could have manually made changes within locale files and no tooling would complain. This could result in locale files which are not in sync with CLDR / or files which are broken.\\n'}\n",

Prior to `emit`, `NgCompiler.prepareEmit` is called to retrieve the Angular transformers which need to be fed to `ts.Program.emit`.\\n7. `emit` is called on the `ts.Program` with the Angular transformers from above, which produces JavaScript code with Angular extensions.\\n', '`NgCompiler` and incremental compilation': '\\nThe Angular compiler is capable of incremental compilation, where information from a previous compilation is used to accelerate the next compilation. During compilation, the compiler produces two major kinds of information: local information (such as component and directive metadata) and global information (such as reified NgModule scopes). Incremental compilation is managed in two ways:\\n\\n1. For most changes, a new `NgCompiler` can selectively inherit local information from a previous instance, and only needs to recompute it where an underlying TypeScript file has change. Global information is always recomputed from scratch in this case.\\n\\n2. For specific changes, such as those in component resources, an `NgCompiler` can be reused in its entirety, and updated to incorporate the effects of such changes without needing to recompute any other information.\\n\\nNote that these two modes differ in terms of whether a new `NgCompiler` instance is needed or whether a previous one can reused. To prevent leaking this implementation complexity and shield consumers from having to manage the lifecycle of `NgCompiler` so specifically, this process is abstracted via `CompilationTicket`s. Consumers first obtain a `CompilationTicket` (depending on the nature of the incoming change), and then use this ticket to retrieve an `NgCompiler` instance. In creating the `CompilationTicket`, the compiler can decide whether to reuse an old `NgCompiler` instance or to create a new one.\\n', 'Asynchronous compilation': '\\nIn some compilation environments (such as the Webpack-driven compilation inside the Angular CLI), various inputs to the compilation are only producible in an asynchronous fashion. For example, SASS compilation of `styleUrls` that link to SASS files requires spawning a child Webpack compilation. To support this, Angular has an asynchronous interface for loading such resources.\\n\\nIf this interface is used, an additional asynchronous step after `NgCompiler` creation is to call `NgCompiler.analyzeAsync` and await its `Promise`. After this operation completes, all resources have been loaded and the rest of the `NgCompiler` API can be used synchronously.\\n', 'Wrapping the `ts.CompilerHost`': \"\\nAngular compilation generates a number of synthetic files (files which did not exist originally as inputs), depending on configuration. Such files can include:\\n\\n* A flat module index file, if requested.\\n* The `__ng_typecheck__.ts` file, which supports template type-checking code.\\n\\nThese files don't exist on disk, but need to appear as such to the `ts.Program`. This is accomplished by wrapping the `ts.CompilerHost` (which abstracts the outside world to the `ts.Program`) in an implementation which provides these synthetic files. This is the primary function of `NgCompilerHost`.\\n\", 'API definitions': \"\\nThe `core` package contains separate API definitions, which are used across the compiler.

            "Parsed sections: {'`imports`': '\\nThe `imports` module attempts to unify all import handling in ngtsc. It powers the compiler\\'s reference system - how the compiler tracks classes like components, directives, NgModules, etc, and how it generates imports to them in user code. At its heart is the `Reference` abstraction, which combines a class `ts.Declaration` with any additional context needed to generate an import of that class in different situations.\\n\\nIn Angular, users do not import the directives and pipes they use in templates directly. Instead, they import an NgModule, and the NgModule exports a set of directives/pipes which will be available in the template of any consumer. When generating code for the template, though, the directives/pipes used there need to be imported directly. This creates a challenge for the compiler: it must choose an ES module specifier from which they can be imported, since the user never provided it.\\n\\nMuch of the logic around imports and references in the compiler is dedicated to answering this question. The compiler has two major modes of operation here:\\n\\n1. Module specifier (import path) tracking\\n\\nIf a directive/pipe is within the user\\'s program, then it can be imported directly. If not (e.g. the directive came from a library in `node_modules`), the compiler will look at the NgModule that caused the directive to be available in the template, look at its import, and attempt to use the same module specifier.\\n\\nThis logic is based on the Angular Package Format, which dictates that libraries are organized into entrypoints, and both an NgModule and its directives/pipes must be exported from the same entrypoint (usually an `index.ts` file).\\n\\nThus, if `CommonModule` is imported from the specifier \\'@angular/common\\', and its `NgIf` directive is used in a template, the compiler will always import `NgIf` from \\'@angular/common\\' as well.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that this logic is transitive. If the user instead imported `BrowserModule` from \\'@angular/platform-browser\\' (which re-exports `CommonModule` and thus `NgIf`), the compiler will note that `BrowserModule` itself imported `CommonModule` from \\'@angular/common\\', and so `NgIf` will be imported from \\'@angular/common\\' still.\\n\\nThis logic of course breaks down for non-Angular Package Format libraries, such as \"internal\" libraries within a monorepo, which frequently don\\'t use `index.ts` files or entrypoints. In this case, the user will likely import NgModules directly from their declaration (e.g. via a \\'lib/module\\' specifier), and the compiler cannot simply assume that the user has exported all of the directives/pipes from the NgModule via this same specifier. In this case a compiler feature called \"aliasing\" kicks in (see below) and generates private exports from the NgModule file.\\n\\n2. Using a `UnifiedModulesHost`\\n\\nThe `ts.CompilerHost` given to the compiler may optionally implement an interface called `UnifiedModulesHost`, which allows an absolute module specifier to be generated for any file. If a `UnifiedModulesHost` is present, the compiler will attempt to directly import all directives and pipes from the file which declares them, instead of going via the specifier of the NgModule as in the first mode described above. This logic is used internally in the Google monorepo.\\n\\nThis approach comes with a significant caveat: the build system may prevent importing from files which are not directly declared dependencies of the current compilation (this is known as \"strict dependency checking\"). This is a problem when attempting to consume a re-exported directive. For example, if the user depends only on \\'@angular/platform-browser\\', imports `BrowserModule` from \\'@angular/platform-browser\\' and attempts to use the re-exported `NgIf`, the compiler cannot import `NgIf` directly from its declaration within \\'@angular/common\\', which is a transitive (but not direct) dependency.\\n\\nTo support these re-exports, a compiler feature called \"aliasing\" will create a re-export of `NgIf` from within @angular/platform-browser when compiling that package. Then, the downstream application compiler can import `NgIf` via this \"alias\" re-export from a direct dependency, instead of needing to import it from a transitive dependency.\\n', 'References': '\\nAt its heart, the compiler keeps track of the types (classes) it\\'s operating on using the `ts.Declaration` of that class. This suffices to _identify_ a class; however, the compiler frequently needs to track not only the class itself, but how that class came to be known in a particular context. For example, the compiler might see that `CommonModule` is included in `AppModule`\\'s imports, but it also needs to keep track of from where `CommonModule` was imported to apply the logic of \"module specifier tracking\" described above.\\n\\nTo do this, the compiler will wrap the `ts.Declaration` of `CommonModule` into a `Reference`. A `Reference` is a pointer to a `ts.Declaration` plus any additional information and context about _how_ that reference came to be.\\n', 'Identifier tracking': \"\\nWhere possible, the compiler tries to use existing user-provided imports to refer to classes, instead of generating new imports. This is possible because `Reference`s keep track of any `ts.Identifier`s encountered which refer to the referenced class. If Angular, in the course of processing a `ts.Expression` (such as the `declarations` array of an NgModule), determines that the `ts.Identifier` points to a `Reference`, it adds the `ts.Identifier` to that `Reference` for future use.\\n\\nThe `Reference.getIdentityIn` method queries the `Reference` for a `ts.Identifier` that's valid in a given `ts.SourceFile`. This is used by the `LocalIdentifierStrategy` when emitting an `Expression` for the `Reference` (see the description of `ReferenceEmitter` below).\\n\", 'Synthetic references': '\\nIn some cases, identifier tracking needs to be disabled for a `Reference`. For example, when the compiler synthesizes a `Reference` as part of \"foreign function evaluation\", the evaluated `ts.Identifier` may not be a direct reference to the `Reference`\\'s class at runtime, even if logically that interpretation makes sense in the context of the current expression.\\n\\nIn these cases, the `Reference`s are marked as `synthetic`, which disables all `ts.Identifier` tracking.\\n', 'Owning modules': '\\nAs described above, one piece of information the compiler tracks about a `Reference` is the module specifier from which it came. This is known as its \"owning module\".\\n\\nFor a `Reference`, the compiler tracks both the module specifier itself as well as the context file which contained this module specifier (which is important for TypeScript module resolution operations).\\n\\nThis information is tracked in `Reference.bestGuessOwningModule`. This field carries the \"best guess\" prefix because the compiler cannot verify that each `Reference` which was extracted from a given ES module is actually exported via that module specifier. This depends on the packaging convention the user chose to use. Since a `Reference` may not belong to any external module, `bestGuessOwningModule` may be `null`.\\n\\nFor convenience, the module specifier as a string is also made available as `Reference.ownedByModuleGuess`.\\n', 'ReferenceEmitter': \"\\nDuring evaluation of `ts.Expression`s, `Reference`s to specific directives/pipes/etc are created. During code generation, imports need to be generated for a particular component's template function, based on these `Reference`s. This job falls to the `ReferenceEmitter`.\\n\\nA `ReferenceEmitter` takes a `Reference` as well as a `ts.SourceFile` which will contain the import, and generates an `Expression` which can be used to refer to the referenced class within that file. This may or may not be an `ExternalExpression` (which would generate an import statement), depending on whether it's possible to rely on an existing import of the class within that file.\\n\\n`ReferenceEmitter` is a wrapper around one or more `ReferenceEmitStrategy` instances. Each strategy is tried in succession until an `Expression` can be determined. An error is produced if no valid mechanism of referring to the referenced class can be found.\\n\", '`LocalIdentifierStrategy`': '\\nThis `ReferenceEmitStrategy` queries the `Reference` for a `ts.Identifier` that\\'s valid in the requested file (see \"identifier tracking\" for `Reference`s above).\\n', '`LogicalProjectStrategy`': '\\nThis `ReferenceEmitStrategy` is used to import referenced classes that are declared in the current project, and not in any third-party or external libraries, whenever `rootDir` or `rootDirs` is set in the TS compiler options.\\n\\nWhen `rootDir`(s) are present, multiple physical directories can be mapped into the same logical namespace. So consider two files `/app/app.cmp.ts` and `/lib/lib.cmp.ts`. Ordinarily, a relative import (such as the kind generated by `RelativePathStrategy`) from the former to the latter would be `../lib/lib.cmp`. However, if both `/app` and `/lib` are project `rootDirs`, then the files within are logically in the same \"directory\", and the correct import is `./lib.cmp`.\\n\\nThe `LogicalProjectStrategy` constructs `LogicalProjectPath`s between files and generates module specifiers that are relative imports within that namespace, honoring the project\\'s `rootDirs` settings.\\n\\nThe `LogicalProjectStrategy` will decline to generate an import into any file which falls outside the project\\'s `rootDirs`, as such a relative specifier is not representable in the merged namespace.\\n', '`RelativePathStrategy`': '\\nThis `ReferenceEmitStrategy` is used to generate relative imports between two files in the project, assuming the layout of files on the disk maps directly to the module specifier namespace. This is the case if the project does not have `rootDir`/`rootDirs` configured in its TS compiler options.\\n', '`AbsoluteModuleStrategy`': '\\nThis `ReferenceEmitStrategy` uses the `bestGuessOwningModule` of a `Reference` to generate an import of the referenced class.\\n\\nNote that the `bestGuessOwningModule` only gives the module specifier for the import, not the symbol name. The user may have renamed the class as part of re-exporting it from an entrypoint, so the `AbsoluteModuleStrategy` searches the exports of the target module and finds the symbol name by which the class is re-exported, if it exists.\\n', '`UnifiedModulesStrategy`': '\\nThis `ReferenceEmitStrategy` uses a `UnifiedModulesHost` to implement the major import mode #2 described at the beginning of this document.\\n\\nUnder this strategy, direct imports to referenced classes are constructed using globally valid absolute module specifiers determined by the `UnifiedModulesHost`.\\n\\nLike with `AbsoluteModuleStrategy`, the `UnifiedModulesHost` only gives the module specifier and not the symbol name, so an appropriate symbol name must be determined by searching the exports of the module.\\n', '`AliasStrategy`': '\\nThe `AliasStrategy` will choose the alias `Expression` of a `Reference`. This strategy is used before the `UnifiedModulesStrategy` to guarantee aliases are preferred to direct imports when available.\\n\\nSee the description of aliasing in the case of `UnifiedModulesAliasingHost` below.\\n', 'Aliasing and re-exports': '\\nIn certain cases, the exports written by the user are not sufficient to guarantee that a downstream compiler will be able to depend on directives/pipes correctly. In these circumstances the compiler\\'s \"aliasing\" system creates new exports to bridge the gaps.\\n\\nAn `AliasingHost` interface allows different aliasing strategies to be chosen based on the needs of the current compilation. It supports two operations:\\n\\n1. Determination of a re-export name, if needed, for a given directive/pipe.\\n\\nWhen compiling an NgModule, the compiler will consult the `AliasingHost` via its `maybeAliasSymbolAs` method to determine whether to add re-exports of any directives/pipes exported (directly or indirectly) by the NgModule.\\n\\n2. Determination of an alias `Expression` for a directive/pipe, based on a re-export that was expected to have been generated previously.\\n\\nWhen the user imports an NgModule from an external library (via a `.d.ts` file), the compiler will construct a \"scope\" of exported directives/pipes that this NgModule makes available to any templates. In the process of constructing this scope, the compiler creates `Reference`s for each directive/pipe.\\n\\nAs part of this operation, the compiler will consult the `AliasingHost` via its `getAliasIn` method to determine whether an alias `Expression` should be used to refer to each class instead of going through other import generation logic. This alias is saved on the `Reference`.\\n\\nBecause the first import of an NgModule from a user library to a `.d.ts` is always from a direct dependency, the result is that all `Reference`s to directives/pipes which can be used from this module will have an associated alias `Expression` specifying how to import them from that direct dependency, instead of from a transitive dependency.\\n\\nAliasing is currently used in two cases:\\n\\n1. To address strict dependency checking issues when using a `UnifiedModulesHost`.\\n2. To support depending on non-Angular Package Format packages (e.g. private libraries in monorepos) which do not have an entrypoint file through which all directives/pipes/modules are exported.\\n\\nIn environments with \"strict dependency checking\" as described above, an NgModule which exports another NgModule from one of its dependencies needs to export its directives/pipes as well, in order to make them available to the downstream compiler.\\n', 'Aliasing under `UnifiedModulesHost`': \"\\nA `UnifiedModulesAliasingHost` implements `AliasingHost` and makes full use of the aliasing system in the case of a `UnifiedModulesHost`.\\n\\nWhen compiling an NgModule, re-exports are added under a stable name for each directive/pipe that's re-exported by the NgModule.\\n\\nWhen importing that NgModule, alias `Expression`s are added to all the `Reference`s for those directives/pipes that are guaranteed to be from a direct dependency.\\n\\n\", 'Private re-exports for non-APF packages': '\\nA `PrivateExportAliasingHost` is used to add re-exports of directives/pipes in the case where the compiler cannot determine that all directives/pipes are re-exported from a common entrypoint (like in the case of an Angular Package Format compilation).\\n\\nIn this case, aliasing is used to proactively add re-exports of directives/pipes to the file of any NgModule which exports them, ensuring they can be imported from the same module specifier as the NgModule itself. This is only done if the user has not already added such exports directly.\\n\\nThis `AliasingHost` does not tag any `Reference`s with aliases, and relies on the action of the `AbsoluteModuleStrategy` described above to find and select the alias re-export when attempting to write an import for a given `Reference`.\\n', 'Default imports': \"\\nThis aspect of the `imports` package is a little different than the rest of the code as it's not concerned with directive/pipe imports. Instead, it's concerned with a different problem: preventing the removal of default import statements which were converted from type-only to value imports through compilation.\\n\", 'Type-to-value compilation': \"\\nThis occurs when a default import is used as a type parameter in a service constructor:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport Foo from 'foo';\\n\\n@Injectable()\\nexport class Svc {\\n  constructor(private foo: Foo) {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere, `Foo` is used in the type position only, but the compiler will eventually generate an `inject(Foo)` call in the factory function for this service. The use of `Foo` like this in the output depends on the import statement surviving compilation.\\n\\nDue to quirks in TypeScript transformers (see below), TypeScript considers the import to be type-only and does not notice the additional usage as a value added during transformation, and so will attempt to remove the import. The default import managing system exists to prevent this.\\n\\nIt consists of two mechanisms:\\n\\n1. A `DefaultImportTracker`, which records information about both default imports encountered in the program as well as usages of those imports added during compilation.\\n\\n2. A TypeScript transformer which processes default import statements and can preserve those which are actually used.\\n\\nThis is accessed via `DefaultImportTracker.importPreservingTransformer`.\\n\", 'Why default imports are problematic': '\\nThis section is the result of speculation, as we have not traced the TypeScript compiler thoroughly.\\n\\nConsider the class:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {Foo} from \\'./foo\\';\\n\\nclass X {\\n  constructor(foo: Foo) {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAngular wants to generate a value expression (`inject(Foo)`), using the value side of the `Foo` type from the constructor.\\n\\nAfter transforms, this roughly looks like:\\n\\n```javascript\\nlet foo_1 = require(\\'./foo\\');\\n\\ninject(foo_1.Foo);\\n```\\n\\nThe Angular compiler takes the `Foo` `ts.Identifier` from the import statement `import {Foo} from \\'./foo\\'`, which has a \"provenance\" in TypeScript that indicates it\\'s associated with the import statement. After transforms, TypeScript will scan the output code and notice this `ts.Identifier` is still present, and so it will choose to preserve the import statement.\\n\\nIf, however, `Foo` was a default import:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport Foo from \\'./foo\\';\\n```\\n\\nThen the generated code depends on a few factors (target/module/esModuleInterop settings), but roughly looks like:\\n\\n\\n```javascript\\nlet foo_1 = require(\\'./foo\\');\\n\\ninject(foo_1.default);\\n```\\n\\nNote in this output, the `Foo` identifier from before has disappeared. TypeScript then does not find any `ts.Identifier`s which point back to the original import statement, and thus it concludes that the import is unused.\\n\\nIt\\'s likely that this case was overlooked in the design of the transformers API.'}\n",

Its goal is to\\nensure that the compiler\\'s incremental performance is largely O(number of files changed in that\\niteration) instead of O(size of the program as a whole), by allowing the compiler to optimize away\\nas much work as possible without sacrificing the correctness of its output.\\n\\nAn incremental compilation receives information about the prior compilation, including\\nits `ts.Program` and the result of ngtsc\\'s analyses of each class in that program.

Skipping emit of a file is the most effective optimizations ngtsc\\ncan do. It\\'s also one of the most challenging. Even if ngtsc\\'s _analysis_ of a specific file is not\\nstale, that file may still need to be re-emitted if other changes in the program impact its\\nsemantics. For example, a change to a component selector affects other components which use that\\nselector in their templates, even though no direct dependency exists between them.\\n\\n* It can reuse template type-checking code\\n\\nTemplate type-checking code is generated using semantic information extracted from the user\\'s\\nprogram. This generation can be expensive, and ngtsc attempts to reuse previous results as much as\\npossible. This optimization can be thought of as a special case of the above re-emit optimization,\\nsince template type-checking code is a particular flavor of \"emit\" for a component.\\n\\nDue to the way that template type-checking works (creation of a second `ts.Program`\\nwith `.ngtypecheck` files containing template type-checking blocks, or TCBs), reuse of template\\ntype-checking code is critical for good performance. Not only is generation of these TCBs expensive,\\nbut forcing TypeScript to re-parse and re-analyze every `.ngtypecheck` file on each incremental\\nchange would be costly as well.\\n\\nThe `incremental` package is dedicated to allowing ngtsc to make these important optimizations\\nsafely.\\n\\nDuring an incremental compilation, the compiler begins with a process called \"reconciliation\",\\nfocused on understanding the differences between the incoming, new `ts.Program` and the\\nlast `ts.Program`. In TypeScript, an unchanged file will have its `ts.SourceFile` AST completely\\nreused. Reconciliation therefore examines the `ts.SourceFile`s of both the old and new programs, and\\nidentifies files which have been added, removed, or changed. This information feeds in to the rest\\nof the incremental compilation process.\\n', 'Reuse of analysis results': '\\nAngular\\'s process of understanding an individual component, directive, or other decorated class is\\nknown as \"analysis\". Analysis is always performed on a class-by-class basis, so the analysis of a\\ncomponent only takes into consideration information present in the `@Component` decorator, and not\\nfor example in the `@NgModule` which declares the component.\\n\\nHowever, analysis _can_ depend on information outside of the decorated class\\'s file. This can happen\\nin two ways:\\n\\n* External resources, such as templates or stylesheets, are covered by analysis.\\n* The partial evaluation of expressions within a class\\'s metadata may descend into symbols imported\\n  from other files.\\n\\nFor example, a directive\\'s selector may be determined via an imported constant:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport {Directive} from \\'@angular/core\\';\\nimport {DIR_SELECTOR} from \\'./selectors\\';\\n\\n@Directive({\\n  selector: DIR_SELECTOR,\\n})\\nexport class Dir {}\\n```\\n\\nThe analysis of this directive _depends on_ the value of `DIR_SELECTOR` from `selectors.ts`.\\nConsequently, if `selectors.ts` changes, `Dir` needs to be re-analyzed, even if `dir.ts` has not\\nchanged.\\n\\nThe `incremental` system provides a mechanism which tracks such dependencies at the file level. The\\npartial evaluation system records dependencies for any given evaluation operation when an import\\nboundary is crossed, building up a file-to-file dependency graph. This graph is then transmitted to\\nthe next incremental compilation, where it can be used to determine, based on the set of files\\nphysically changed on disk, which files have _logically_ changed and need to be re-analyzed.\\n', 'Reuse of emit results': '\\nIn plain TypeScript programs, the compiled JavaScript code for any given input file (e.g. `foo.ts`)\\ndepends only on the code within that input file. That is, only the contents of `foo.ts` can affect\\nthe generated contents written to `foo.js`. The TypeScript compiler can therefore perform a very\\nsimple optimization, and avoid generating and emitting code for any input files which do not change.\\nThis is important for good incremental build performance, as emitting a file is a very expensive\\noperation.\\n\\n(in practice, the TypeScript feature of `const enum` declarations breaks this overly simple model)\\n\\nIn Angular applications, however, this optimization is not nearly so simple. The emit of a `.js`\\nfile in Angular is affected in four main ways:\\n\\n* Just as in plain TS, it depends on the contents of the input `.ts` file.\\n* It can be affected by expressions that were statically evaluated during analysis of any decorated\\n  classes in the input, and these expressions can depend on other files.\\n\\nFor example, the directive with its selector specified via the imported `DIR_SELECTOR` constant\\nabove has compilation output which depends on the value of `DIR_SELECTOR`. Therefore, the `dir.js`\\nfile needs to be emitted whenever the value of the selector constant in `selectors.ts` changes, even\\nif `dir.ts` itself is unchanged. The compiler therefore will re-emit `dir.js` if the `dir.ts` file\\nis determined to have _logically_ changed, using the same dependency graph that powers analysis\\nreuse.\\n\\n* Components can have external templates and CSS stylesheets which influence their compilation.\\n\\nThese are incorporated into a component\\'s analysis dependencies.\\n\\n* Components (and NgModules) are influenced by the NgModule graph, which controls which directives\\n  and pipes are \"in scope\" for each component\\'s template.\\n\\nThis last relationship is the most difficult, as there is no import relationship between a component\\nand the directives and pipes it uses in its template. That means that a component file can be\\nlogically unchanged, but still require re-emit if one of its dependencies has been updated in a way\\nthat influences the compilation of the component.\\n', 'Example': '\\nFor example, the output of a compiled component includes an array called `directiveDefs`, listing\\nall of the directives and components actually used within the component\\'s template. This array is\\nbuilt by combining the template (from analysis) with the \"scope\" of the component - the set of\\ndirectives and pipes which are available for use in its template. This scope is synthesized from the\\nanalysis of not just the component\\'s NgModule, but other NgModules which might be imported, and the\\ncomponents/directives that those NgModules export, and their analysis data as well.\\n\\nThese dependencies of a component on the directives/pipes it consumes, and the NgModule structures\\nthat made them visible, are not captured in the file-level dependency graph. This is due to the\\npeculiar nature of NgModule and component relationships: NgModules import components, so there is\\nnever a reference from a component to its NgModule, or any of its directive or pipe dependencies.\\n\\nIn code, this looks like:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// dir.ts\\n@Directive({selector: \\'[dir]\\'})\\nexport class Dir {}\\n\\n// cmp.ts\\n@Component({\\n  selector: \\'cmp\\',\\n  template: \\'<div dir></div>\\', // Matches the `[dir]` selector\\n})\\nexport class Cmp {}\\n\\n// mod.ts\\nimport {Dir} from \\'./dir\\';\\nimport {Cmp} from \\'./cmp\\';\\n\\n@NgModule({declarations: [Dir, Cmp]})\\nexport class Mod {}\\n```\\n\\nHere, `Cmp` never directly imports or refers to `Dir`, but it _does_ consume the directive in its\\ntemplate. During emit, `Cmp` would receive a `directiveDefs` array:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// cmp.js\\nimport * as i1 from \\'./dir\\';\\n\\nexport class Cmp {\\n  static cmp = defineComponent({\\n    ...\\n    directiveDefs: [i1.Dir],\\n  });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf `Dir`\\'s selector were to change to `[other]` in an incremental step, it might no longer\\nmatch `Cmp`\\'s template, in which case `cmp.js` would need to be re-emitted.\\n', 'SemanticSymbols': '\\nFor each decorated class being processed, the compiler creates a `SemanticSymbol` representing the\\ndata regarding that class that\\'s involved in these \"indirect\" relationships. During the\\ncompiler\\'s `resolve` phase, these `SemanticSymbol`s are connected together to form a \"semantic\\ndependency graph\". Two classes of data are recorded:\\n\\n* Information about the public shape API of the class.\\n\\nFor example, directives have a public API which includes their selector, any inputs or outputs, and\\ntheir `exportAs` name if any.\\n\\n* Information about the emit shape of the class, including any dependencies on\\n  other `SemanticSymbol`s.\\n\\nThis information allows the compiler to determine which classes have been semantically affected by\\nother changes in the program (and therefore need to be re-emitted) according to a simple algorithm:\\n\\n1.

For each `SemanticSymbol`, determine if its emit shape was affected by any of the public API\\n   changes (that is, if it depends on a symbol with public API changes).\\n', 'Determination of public API changes': '\\nThe first step of this algorithm is to determine, for each `SemanticSymbol`, if its public API has\\nbeen affected. Doing this requires knowing which `SemanticSymbol` in the previous program\\ncorresponds to the current version of the symbol. There are two ways that symbols can be \"matched\":\\n\\n* The old and new symbols share the same `ts.ClassDeclaration`.\\n\\nThis is true whenever the `ts.SourceFile` declaring the class has not changed between the old and\\nnew programs. The public API of the symbol may still have changed (such as when a directive\\'s\\nselector is determined by a constant imported from another file, like in one of the examples above).\\nBut if the declaration file itself has not changed, then the previous symbol can be directly found\\nthis way.\\n\\n* By its unique path and name.\\n\\nIf the file _has_ changed, then symbols can be located by their declaration path plus their name, if\\nthey have a name that\\'s guaranteed to be unique. Currently, this means that the classes are declared\\nat the top level of the source file, so their names are in the module\\'s scope. If this is the case,\\nthen a symbol can be matched to its ancestor even if the declaration itself has changed in the\\nmeantime. Note that there is no guarantee the symbol will be of the same type - an incremental step\\nmay change a directive into a component, or even into a pipe or injectable.\\n\\nOnce a previous symbol is located, its public API can be compared against the current version of the\\nsymbol. Symbols without a valid ancestor are assumed to have changed in their public API.\\n\\nThe compiler processes all `SemanticSymbol`s and determines the `Set` of them which have experienced\\npublic API changes. In the example above, this `Set` would include the `DirectiveSymbol` for `Dir`,\\nsince its selector would have changed.\\n', 'Determination of emit requirements': '\\nFor each potential output file, the compiler then looks at all declared `SemanticSymbol`s and uses\\ntheir ancestor symbol (if present) as well as the `Set` of public API changes to make a\\ndetermination if that file needs be emitted.\\n\\nIn the case of a `ComponentSymbol`, for example, the symbol tracks the dependencies of the component\\nwhich will go into the `directiveDefs` array. If that array is different, the component needs to be\\nre-emitted. Even if the same directives are referenced, if one of those directives has changed in\\nits public API, the emitted output (especially when generating prelink library code) may be\\naffected, and the component needs to be re-emitted.\\n', '`SemanticReference`s': \"\\n`ComponentSymbol`s track their dependencies via an intermediate type, a `SemanticReference`.

It\\'s used to perform actual type checking of templates (similarly to how TypeScript checks code for type errors). It also provides the `TemplateTypeChecker` API which is a conceptual analogue to TypeScript\\'s own `ts.TypeChecker`, exposing various semantic details about template types to consumers such as the Angular Language Service.\\n\\nThe template type-checking engine is complex, as TypeScript itself is not very pluggable when it comes to the type system. The main algorithm for template type-checking is as follows:\\n\\n1. The input `ts.Program` is analyzed, and information about directives/pipes as well as candidate templates is collected.\\n2. Each candidate template is converted into a \"type-check block\", or TCB, a TypeScript function that semantically describes the operations in the template as well as their types.\\n3. A derivative `ts.Program` is created from the user\\'s input program from step 1, plus the newly generated TCBs.\\n4. TypeScript is asked to produce diagnostics for the TCBs, which arise from type errors within the template.\\n5. TCB diagnostics are converted to template diagnostics and reported to the user.\\n\\nThis algorithm relies extensively on TypeScript\\'s ability to rapidly type check incremental changes in a `ts.Program` for its performance characteristics. Much of its design is optimized to ensure TypeScript has to do the minimum incremental work to check the new `ts.Program`.\\n', 'Type Check Blocks': \"\\nTo understand and check the types of various operations and structures within templates, the `typecheck` system maps them to TypeScript code, encoding them in such a way as to express the intent of the operation within the type system.\\n\\n\\nTCBs are not ever emitted, nor are they referenced from any other code (they're unused code as far as TypeScript is concerned). Their _runtime_ effect is therefore unimportant. What matters is that they express to TypeScript the type relationships of directives, bindings, and other entities in the template. Type errors within TCBs translate directly to type errors in the original template.\\n\", 'Theory': \"\\nGiven a component `SomeCmp`, its TCB takes the form of a function:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  // TCB code\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEncoding the TCB as a function serves two purposes:\\n\\n1. It provides a lexical scope in which to declare variables without fear of collisions.\\n2. It provides a convenient location (the parameter list) to declare the component context.\\n\\nThe component context is the theoretical component instance associated with the template. Expressions within the template often refer to properties of this component.\\n\\nFor example, if `SomeCmp`'s template has an interpolation expression `{{foo.bar}}`, this suggests that `SomeCmp` has a property `foo`, and that `foo` itself is an object with a property `bar` (or in a type sense, that the type of `SomeCmp.foo` has a property `bar`).\\n\\nSuch a binding is expressed in the TCB function, using the `this` parameter as the component instance:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  '' + this.foo.bar;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf `SomeCmp` does not have a `foo` property, then TypeScript will produce a type error/diagnostic for the expression `this.foo`. If `this.foo` does exist, but is not of a type that has a `bar` property, then TypeScript will catch that too. By mapping the template expression `{{foo.bar}}` to TypeScript code, the compiler has captured its _intent_ in the TCB in a way that TypeScript can validate.\\n\", 'Types of template declarations': '\\nNot only can a template consume properties declared from its component, but various structures within a template can also be considered \"declarations\" which have types of their own. For example, the template:\\n\\n```html\\n<input #name>\\n{{name.value}}\\n```\\n\\ndeclares a single `<input>` element with a local ref `#name`, meaning that within this template `name` refers to the `<input>` element. The `{{name.value}}` interpolation is reading the `value` property of this element.\\n\\nWithin the TCB, the `<input>` element is treated as a declaration, and the compiler leverages the powerful type inference of `document.createElement`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  var _t1 = document.createElement(\\'input\\');\\n  \\'\\' + _t1.value;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `_t1` variable represents the instance of the `<input>` element within the template. This statement will never be executed, but its initialization expression is used to infer a correct type of `_t1` (`HTMLInputElement`), using the `document.createElement` typings that TypeScript provides.\\n\\nBy knowing the type of this element, the expression involving the `name` local ref can be translated into the TCB as `_t1.value`. TypeScript will then validate that `_t1` has a `value` property (really, that the `HTMLInputElement` type has a `value` property).\\n', 'Directive types': '\\nJust like with HTML elements, directives present on elements within the template (including those directives which are components) are treated as declarations as well. Consider the template:\\n\\n```html\\n<other-cmp [foo]=\"bar\"></other-cmp>\\n```\\n\\nThe TCB for this template looks like:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  var _t1: OtherCmp = null!;\\n  _t1.foo = this.bar;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSince `<other-cmp>` is a component, the TCB declares `_t1` to be of that component\\'s type. This allows for the binding `[foo]=\"bar\"` to be expressed in TypeScript as `_t1.foo = this.bar` - an assignment to `OtherCmp`\\'s `@Input` for `foo` of the `bar` property from the template\\'s context. TypeScript can then type check this operation and produce diagnostics if the type of `this.bar` is not assignable to the `_t1.foo` property which backs the `@Input`.\\n', 'Generic directives & type constructors': '\\nThe above declaration of `_t1` using the component\\'s type only works when the directive/component class is not generic. If `OtherCmp` were declared as:\\n\\n```typescript\\nexport class OtherCmp<T> {\\n  ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nthen the compiler could not write\\n\\n```typescript\\nvar _t1: OtherCmp<?> = ...;\\n```\\n\\nwithout picking a value for the generic type parameter `T` of `OtherCmp`. How should the compiler know what type the user intended for this component instance?\\n\\nOrdinarily, for a plain TypeScript class such as `Set<T>`, the generic type parameters of an instance are determined in one of two ways:\\n\\n1. Directly, via construction: `new Set<string>()`\\n2. Indirectly, via inference from constructor parameters: `new Set([\\'foo\\', \\'bar\\']); // Set<string>`\\n\\nFor directives, neither of these options makes sense. Users do not write direct constructor calls to directives in a template, so there is no mechanism by which they can specify generic types directly. Directive constructors are also dependency-injected, and generic types cannot be used as DI tokens and so they cannot be inferred from DI.\\n\\nInstead, conceptually, the generic type of a directive depends on the types bound to its _inputs_. This is immediately evident for a directive such as `NgFor`:\\n\\n```typescript\\n\\n@Directive({selector: \\'[ngFor]\\'})\\nexport class NgFor<T> {\\n  @Input() ngForOf!: Iterable<T>;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n(Note: the real `NgFor` directive is more complex than the simplistic version examined here, but the same principles still apply)\\n\\nIn this case, the `T` type parameter of `NgFor` represents the value type of the `Iterable` over which we\\'re iterating. This depends entirely on the `Iterable` passed to `NgFor` - if the user passes a `User[]` array, then this should conceptually create an `NgFor<User>` instance. If they pass a `string[]` array, it should be an `NgFor<string>` instead.\\n\\nTo infer a correct type for a generic directive, the TCB system generates a **type constructor** for the directive. The type constructor is a \"fake\" constructor which can be used to infer the directive type based on any provided input bindings.\\n\\nA type constructor for the simplistic `NgFor` directive above would look like:\\n\\n```typescript\\ndeclare function ctor1<T>(inputs: {ngForOf?: Iterable<T>}): NgFor<T>;\\n```\\n\\nThis type constructor can then be used to infer the instance type of a usage of `NgFor` based on provided bindings. For example, the template:\\n\\n```html=\\n<div *ngFor=\"let user of users\">...</div>\\n```\\n\\nWould use the above type constructor in its TCB:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  var _t1 = ctor1({ngForOf: this.users});\\n  // Assuming this.users is User[], then _t1 is inferred as NgFor<User>.\\n}\\n```\\n\\nA single type constructor for a directive can be used in multiple places, whenever an instance of the directive is present in the template.\\n', 'Nested templates & structural directives': '\\n`NgFor` is a structural directive, meaning that it applies to a nested `<ng-template>`. That is, the template:\\n\\n```html\\n<div *ngFor=\"let user of users\">\\n  {{user.name}}\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nis syntactic sugar for:\\n\\n```html\\n<ng-template ngFor let-user=\"$implicit\" [ngForOf]=\"users\">\\n  <div>{{user.name}}</div>\\n</ng-template>\\n```\\n\\nThe `NgFor` directive injects a `TemplateRef` for this _embedded view_, as well as a `ViewContainerRef`, and at runtime creates dynamic instances of this nested template (one per row). Each instance of the embedded view has its own \"template context\" object, from which any `let` bindings are read.\\n\\nIn the TCB, the template context of this nested template is itself a declaration with its own type. Since a structural directive can in theory create embedded views with any context object it wants, the template context type always starts as `any`:\\n\\n```typescript\\ndeclare function ctor1(inputs: {ngForOf?: Iterable<T>}): NgFor<T>;\\n\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  // _t1 is the NgFor directive instance, inferred as NgFor<User>.\\n  var _t1 = ctor1({ngForOf: this.users});\\n\\n  // _t2 is the context type for the embedded views created by the NgFor structural directive.\\n  var _t2: any;\\n  \\n  // _t3 is the let-user variable within the embedded view.\\n  var _t3 = _t2.$implicit;\\n  \\n  // Represents the `{{user.name}}` interpolation within the embedded view.\\n  \\'\\' + _t3.name;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote that the `any` type of the embedded view context `_t2` effectively disables type-checking of the `{{user.name}}` expression, because the compiler has no idea what type `user` will be when `NgFor` instantiates this embedded view. Since this instantiation is imperative code, the compiler cannot know what `NgFor` will do.\\n', 'Template context hints': \"\\nTo solve this problem, the template type-checking engine allows structural directives to _declaratively_ narrow the context type of any embedded views they create. The example `NgFor` directive would do this by declaring a static `ngTemplateContextGuard` function:\\n\\n```typescript\\n@Directive({selector: '[ngFor]'})\\nexport class NgFor<T> {\\n  @Input() ngForOf!: Iterable<T>;\\n  \\n  static ngTemplateContextGuard<T>(dir: NgFor<T>, ctx: any): ctx is NgForContext<T> {\\n    return true; // implementation is not important\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nexport interface NgForContext<T> {\\n  $implicit: T;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `typecheck` system is aware of the presence of this method on any structural directives used in templates, and uses it to narrow the type of its context declarations. So with this method on `NgFor`, the template from before would now generate a TCB of:\\n\\n```typescript\\ndeclare function ctor1(inputs: {ngForOf?: Iterable<T>}): NgFor<T>;\\n\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  // _t1 is the NgFor directive instance, inferred as NgFor<User>.\\n  var _t1 = ctor1({ngForOf: this.users});\\n\\n  // _t2 is the context type for the embedded views created by the NgFor structural directive.\\n  var _t2: any;\\n  \\n  if (NgFor.ngTemplateContextGuard(_t1, _t2)) {\\n    // NgFor's ngTemplateContextGuard has narrowed the type of _t2\\n    // based on the type of _t1 (the NgFor directive itself).\\n    // Within this `if` block, _t2 is now of type NgForContext<User>.\\n    \\n    // _t3 is the let-user variable within the embedded view.\\n    // Because _t2 is narrowed, _t3 is now of type User.\\n    var _t3 = _t2.$implicit;\\n\\n    // Represents the `{{user.name}}` interpolation within the embedded view.\\n    '' + _t3.name;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBecause the `NgFor` directive _declared_ to the template type checking engine what type it intends to use for embedded views it creates, the TCB has full type information for expressions within the nested template for the `*ngFor` invocation, and the compiler is able to correctly type check the `{{user.name}}` expression.\\n\", \"'binding' guard hints\": '\\n`NgIf` requires a similar, albeit not identical, operation to perform type narrowing with its nested template. Instead of narrowing the template context, `NgIf` wants to narrow the actual type of the expression within its binding. Consider the template:\\n\\n```html\\n<div *ngIf=\"user !== null\">\\n  {{user.name}}\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nObviously, if `user` is potentially `null`, then this `NgIf` is intended to only show the `<div>` when `user` actually has a value. However, from a type-checking perspective, the expression `user.name` is not legal if `user` is potentially `null`. So if this template was rendered into a TCB as:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  // Type of the NgIf directive instance.\\n  var _t1: NgIf;\\n  \\n  // Binding *ngIf=\"user != null\".\\n  _t1.ngIf = this.user !== null;\\n  \\n  // Nested template interpolation `{{user.name}}`\\n  \\'\\' + this.user.name;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen the `\\'\\' + user.name` line would produce a type error that `user` might be `null`. At runtime, though, the `NgIf` prevents this condition by only instantiating its embedded view if its bound `ngIf` expression is truthy.\\n\\nSimilarly to `ngTemplateContextGuard`, the template type checking engine allows `NgIf` to express this behavior by adding a static field:\\n\\n```typescript\\n@Directive({selector: \\'[ngIf]\\'})\\nexport class NgIf {\\n  @Input() ngIf!: boolean;\\n  \\n  static ngTemplateGuard_ngIf: \\'binding\\';\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe presence and type of this static property tells the template type-checking engine to reflect the bound expression for its `ngIf` input as a guard for any embedded views created by the structural directive. This produces a TCB:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  // Type of the NgIf directive instance.\\n  var _t1: NgIf;\\n  \\n  // Binding *ngIf=\"user != null\".\\n  _t1.ngIf = this.user !== null;\\n  \\n  // Guard generated due to the `ngTemplateGuard_ngIf` declaration by the NgIf directive.\\n  if (user !== null) {\\n    // Nested template interpolation `{{user.name}}`.\\n    // `this.user` here is appropriately narrowed to be non-nullable.\\n    \\'\\' + this.user.name;\\n  } \\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe guard expression causes TypeScript to narrow the type of `this.user` within the `if` block and identify that `this.user` cannot be `null` within the embedded view context, just as `NgIf` itself does during rendering.\\n', 'Generation process': '\\nAngular templates allow forward references. For example, the template:\\n\\n```html\\nThe value is: {{in.value}}\\n<input #in>\\n```\\n\\ncontains an expression which makes use of the `#in` local reference before the targeted `<input #in>` element is declared. Since such forward references are not legal in TypeScript code, the TCB may need to declare and check template structures in a different order than the template itself.\\n', 'Two phase generation': '\\nTo support this out-of-order generation, the template type checking engine processes templates using an abstraction of known as a `TcbOp`, or TCB operation. `TcbOp`s have two main behaviors:\\n\\n1. Executing a `TcbOp` appends code to the TCB being generated.\\n2. Executing a `TcbOp` optionally returns an identifier or expression, which can be used by other operations to refer to some aspect of the generated structure.\\n\\nThe main algorithm for TCB generation then makes use of this abstraction:\\n\\n1. The template is processed in a depth-first manner, and `TcbOp`s representing the code to be generated for the structures and expressions within are enqueued into a `TcbOp` queue.\\n2. Execution of operations begins from the start of the queue.\\n3. As each `TcbOp` is executed, its result is recorded.\\n4. An executing `TcbOp` may request the results of other `TcbOp`s for any dependencies, even `TcbOp`s which appear later in the queue and have not yet executed.\\n5. Such dependency `TcbOp`s are executed \"on demand\", when requested.\\n\\nThis potential out-of-order execution of `TcbOp`s allows for the TCB ordering to support forward references within templates. The above forward reference example thus results in a `TcbOp` queue of two operations:\\n\\n```typescript\\n[\\n  TcbTextInterpolationOp(`in.value`),\\n  TcbElementOp(\\'<input #in>\\'),\\n]\\n```\\n\\nExecution of the first `TcbTextInterpolationOp` will attempt to generate code representing the expression. Doing this requires knowing the type of the `in` reference, which maps to the element node for the `<input>`. Therefore, as part of executing the `TcbTextInterpolationOp`, the execution of the `TcbElementOp` will be requested. This operation produces TCB code for the element:\\n\\n```typescript\\nvar t1 = document.createElement(\\'input\\');\\n```\\n\\nand returns the expression `t1` which represents the element type. The `TcbTextInterpolationOp` can then finish executing and produce its code:\\n\\n```typescript\\n\\'\\' + t1.value;\\n```\\n\\nresulting in a final TCB:\\n\\n```typescript\\nvar t1 = document.createElement(\\'input\\');\\n\\'\\' + t1.value;\\n```\\n\\nThis ordering resolves the forward reference from the original template.\\n\\n', 'Tracking of `TcbOp`s': '\\nIn practice, a `TcbOp` queue is maintained as an array, where each element begins as a `TcbOp` and is later replaced with the resulting `ts.Expression` once the operation is executed. As `TcbOp`s are generated for various template structures, the index of these operations is recorded. Future dependencies on those operations can then be satisfied by looking in the queue at the appropriate index. The contents will either be a `TcbOp` which has yet to be executed, or the result of the required operation.\\n', '`Scope`': \"\\nAngular templates are nested structures, as the main template can contain embedded views, which can contain their own views. Much like in other programming languages, this leads to a scoped hierarchy of symbol visibility and name resolution.\\n\\nThis is reflected in the TCB generation system via the `Scope` class, which actually performs the TCB generation itself. Each embedded view is its own `Scope`, with its own `TcbOp` queue.\\n\\nWhen a parent `Scope` processing a template encounters an `<ng-template>` node:\\n\\n1. a new child `Scope` is created from the nodes of the embedded view.\\n2. a `TcbTemplateBodyOp` is added to the parent scope's queue, which upon execution triggers generation of the child `Scope`'s TCB code and inserts it into the parent's code at the right position.\\n\\nResolution of names (such as local refs) within the template is also driven by the `Scope` hierarchy. Resolution of a name within a particular embedded view begins in that view's `Scope`. If the name is not defined there, resolution proceeds upwards to the parent `Scope`, all the way up to the root template `Scope`.\\n\\nIf the name resolves in any given `Scope`, the associated `TcbOp` can be executed and returned. If the name does not resolve even at the root scope, then it's treated as a reference to the component context for the template.\\n\", 'Breaking cycles': '\\nIt\\'s possible for a template to contain a referential cycle. As a contrived example, if a component is generic over one of its inputs:\\n\\n```html\\n<generic-cmp #ref [in]=\"ref.value\"></generic-cmp>\\n```\\n\\nHere, type-checking the `[in]` binding requires knowing the type of `ref`, which is the `<generic-cmp>`. But the `<generic-cmp>` type is inferred using a type constructor for the component which requires the `[in]` binding expression:\\n\\n```typescript\\ndeclare function ctor1<T>(inputs: {in?: T}): GenericCmp<T>;\\n\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  // Not legal: cannot refer to t1 (ref) before its declaration.\\n  var t1 = ctor1({in: t1.value});\\n\\n  t1.in = t1.value;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis is only a cycle in the _type_ sense. At runtime, the component is created before its inputs are set, so no cycle exists.\\n\\nTo get around this, `TcbOp`s may optionally provide a fallback value via a `circularFallback()` method, which will be used in the event that evaluation of a `TcbOp` attempts to re-enter its own evaluation. In the above example, the `TcbOp` for the directive type declares a fallback which infers a type for the directive _without_ using its bound inputs:\\n\\n```typescript\\ndeclare function ctor1<T>(inputs: {in?: T}): GenericCmp<T>;\\n\\nfunction tcb(this: SomeCmp): void {\\n  // Generated to break the cycle for `ref` - infers a placeholder\\n  // type for the component without using any of its input bindings.\\n  var t1 = ctor1(null!);\\n  \\n  // Infer the real type of the component using the `t1` placeholder\\n  // type for `ref`.\\n  var t2 = ctor1({in: t1.value});\\n\\n  // Check the binding to [in] using the real type of `ref`.\\n  t2.in = t2.value;\\n}\\n```\\n', 'Optional operations': \"\\nSome `TcbOp`s are marked as optional. Optional operations are never executed as part of processing the op queue, and are skipped when encountered directly. However, other ops may depend on the results of optional operations, and the optional ops are then executed when requested in this manner.\\n\\nThe TCB node generated to represent a DOM element type (`TcbElementOp`) is an example of such an optional operation. Such nodes are only useful if the type of the element is referenced in some other context (such as via a `#ref` local reference). If not, then including it in the TCB only serves to bloat the TCB and increase the time it takes TypeScript to process it.\\n\\nTherefore, the `TcbElementOp` is optional. If nothing requires the element type, it won't be executed and no code will be generated for the element node.\\n\", 'Source mapping and diagnostic translation': \"\\nOnce TCB code is generated, TypeScript is able to process it. One use case is to have TypeScript produce diagnostics related to type issues within the TCB code, which indicate type issues within the template itself. These diagnostics are of course expressed in terms of the TCB itself, but the compiler wants to report diagnostics to the user in terms of the original template text.\\n\\nTo do this, the template type checking system is capable of mapping from the TCB back to the original template. The algorithm to perform this mapping relies on the emission of source mapping information into the TCB itself, in the form of comments.\\n\\nConsider a template expression of the form:\\n\\n```html\\n{{foo.bar}}\\n```\\n\\nThe generated TCB code for this expression would look like:\\n\\n```typescript\\n'' + this.foo.bar;\\n```\\n\\nWhat actually gets generated for this expression looks more like:\\n\\n```typescript\\n'' + (this.foo /* 3,5 */).bar /* 3,9 */;\\n```\\n\\nThe trailing comment for each node in the TCB indicates the template offsets for the corresponding template nodes. If for example TypeScript returns a diagnostic for the `this.foo` part of the expression (such as if `foo` is not a valid property on the component context), the attached comment can be used to map this diagnostic back to the original template's `foo` node.\\n\", '`TemplateId`': '\\nAs multiple TCBs can be present in a single typecheck file, an additional layer of mapping is necessary to determine the component and template for a given TCB diagnostic.\\n\\nDuring TCB generation, a numeric `TemplateId` is assigned to each template declared within a given input file. These `TemplateId` are attached in a comment to the TCBs for each template within the corresponding typecheck files. So the full algorithm for mapping a diagnostic back to the original template involves two steps:\\n\\n1. Locate the top level TCB function declaration that contains the TCB node in error, extract its `TemplateId`, and use that to locate the component and template in question.\\n2. Locate the closest source map comment to the TCB node in error, and combine that with knowledge of the template to locate the template node in error to produce the template diagnostic.\\n', 'Ignore markers': '\\nOccasionally, code needs to be generated in the TCB that should not produce diagnostics. For example, a safe property navigation operation `a?.b` is mapped to a TypeScript ternary operation `a ? a.b : undefined` (the actual code here may be more complex). If the original `a` expression is in error, then redundant diagnostics would be produced from both instances of `a` in the generated TCB code.\\n\\nTo avoid this, generated code can be marked with a special comment indicating that any diagnostics produced within should be ignored and not converted into template diagnostics.\\n', 'Why not real sourcemaps?': \"\\nTypeScript unfortunately cannot consume sourcemaps, only produce them. Therefore, it's impossible to generate a source map to go along with the TCB code and feed it to TypeScript.\\n\", 'Generation diagnostics': '\\nNot all template errors will be caught by TypeScript from generated TCB code. The template type checking engine may also detect errors during the creation of the TCB itself. Several classes of errors are caught this way:\\n\\n* DOM schema errors, like elements that don\\'t exist or attributes that aren\\'t correct.\\n* Missing pipes.\\n* Missing `#ref` targets.\\n* Duplicate `let-variable`s.\\n* Attempts to write to a `let-variable`.\\n\\nThese errors manifest as \"generation diagnostics\", diagnostics which are produced during TCB generation, before TCB code is fed to TypeScript. They\\'re ultimately reported together with any converted TCB diagnostics, but are tracked separately by the type checking system.\\n', 'Inline operations': '\\nIn certain cases, generation of TCBs as separate, independent structures may not be possible.\\n', 'Inline type constructors': '\\nThe mechanics of generic directive type constructors were described above. However, the example given was for a directive with an unbounded generic type. If the directive has a _bounded_ generic type, then the type bounds must be repeated as part of the type constructor. For example, consider the directive:\\n\\n```typescript\\n@Directive({selector: \\'[dir]\\'})\\nexport class MyDir<T extends string> {\\n  @Input() value: T;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn order to properly infer and check the type of this directive, the type constructor must include the generic bounds:\\n\\n```typescript\\ndeclare function ctor1<T extends string>(inputs: {value?: T}): MyDir<T>;\\n```\\n\\nA generic bound for a type parameter is an arbitrary type, which may contain references to other types. These other types may be imported, or declared locally in the same file as a directive. This means that copying the generic bounds into the type constructor for the directive is not always straightforward, as the TCB which requires this type constructor is usually not emitted into the same file as the directive itself.\\n\\nFor example, copying the generic bounds is not possible for the directive:\\n\\n```typescript\\ninterface PrivateInterface {\\n  field: string;\\n}\\n\\n@Directive({selector: \\'[dir]\\'})\\nexport class MyDir<T extends PrivateInterface> {\\n  @Input() value: T;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn such cases, the type checking system falls back to an alternative mechanism for declaring type constructors: adding them as static methods on the directive class itself. As part of the type checking phase, the above directive would be transformed to:\\n\\n```typescript\\n\\ninterface PrivateInterface {\\n  field: string;\\n}\\n\\n@Directive({selector: \\'[dir]\\'})\\nexport class MyDir<T extends PrivateInterface> {\\n  @Input() value: T;\\n  \\n  static ngTypeCtor<T extends PrivateInterface>(inputs: {value?: T}): MyDir<T> { return null!; }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPutting the type constructor declaration within the directive class itself allows the generic signature to be copied without issue, as any references to other types in the same file will still be valid. The type constructor can then be consumed from a TCB as `MyDir.ngTypeCtor`. This is known as an \"inline\" type constructor.\\n\\nAdditions of such inline type checking code have significant ramifications on the performance of template type checking, as discussed below.\\n', 'Inline Type Check Blocks': '\\nA similar problem exists for generic components and the declaration of TCBs. A TCB function must also copy the generic bounds of its context component:\\n\\n```typescript\\nfunction tcb<T extends string>(this: SomeCmp<T>): void {\\n  /* tcb code */\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf `SomeCmp`\\'s generic bounds are more complex and reference types that cannot be safely reproduced in the separate context of the TCB, then a similar workaround is employed: the compiler generates the TCB as an \"inline\" static method on the component.\\n\\nThis can also happen for components which aren\\'t themselves importable:\\n\\n```typescript\\nit(\\'should type-check components declared within functions\\', () => {\\n  @Component({\\n    selector: \\'some-cmp\\',\\n    template: \\'{{foo.bar}}\\'})\\n  class SomeCmp {\\n    foo: Foo = {...};\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nSuch component declarations are still processed by the compiler and can still be type checked using inline TCBs.\\n', '`Environment`': '\\nTCBs are not standalone, and require supporting code such as imports to be properly checked. Additionally, multiple TCBs can share declarations regarding common dependencies, such as type constructors for directives as well as pipe instances.\\n\\nEach TCB is therefore generated in the context of an `Environment`, which loosely represents the file which will ultimately contain the TCB code.\\n\\nDuring TCB generation, the `Environment` is used to obtain references to imported types, type constructors, and other shared structures.\\n\\n', '`TypeCheckingConfig`': '\\n`Environment` also carries the `TypeCheckingConfig`, an options interface which controls the specifics of TCB generation. Through the `TypeCheckingConfig`, a consumer can enable or disable various kinds of strictness checks and other TCB operations.\\n', 'The `TemplateTypeChecker`': \"\\nThe main interface used by consumers to interact with the template type checking system is the `TemplateTypeChecker`. Methods on this interface allow for various operations related to TCBs, such as:\\n\\n* Generation of diagnostics.\\n* Retrieving `Symbol`s (the template equivalent to TypeScript's `ts.Symbol`) for template nodes.\\n* Retrieving TCB locations suitable for autocompletion operations.\\n\", 'Symbols': '\\nThe TCB structures representing specific template nodes and operations are highly useful for \"code intelligence\" purposes, not just for type checking. For example, consider the \"Go to Definition\" function within an IDE. Within TypeScript code, TypeScript\\'s language service can access semantic information about an identifier under the user\\'s cursor, and locate the referenced declaration for that identifier.\\n\\nBecause TCBs are TypeScript code, the TypeScript language service can be used within TCB code to locate definitions in a similar manner. Such a \"template language service\" works in the following manner:\\n\\n1. Find the template node under the user\\'s cursor.\\n2. Locate its equivalent structure in the TCB.\\n3. Ask TypeScript\\'s language service to perform the requested operation on the TCB node.\\n\\nStep 2 in this algorithm is made possible by the `TemplateTypeChecker`\\'s APIs for retrieving `Symbol`s for template nodes. A `Symbol` is a structure describing the TCB information associated with a given template node, including positions within the TCB where type information about the node in question can be found.\\n\\nFor example, an `ElementSymbol` contains a TCB location for the element type, as well as any directives which may be present on the element. Such information can be used by a consumer to query TypeScript for further information about the types present in the template for that element. This is used in the Angular Language Service to implement many of its features.\\n', 'The type checking workflow': \"\\nLike TypeScript's `ts.TypeChecker`, the `TemplateTypeChecker`'s operations are lazy. TCB code for a given template is only generated on demand, to satisfy a query for information about that specific template. Once generated, future queries regarding that template can be answered using the existing TCB structure.\\n\\nThe lazy algorithm used by the `TemplateTypeChecker` is as follows.\\n\\n1. Given a query, determine which (if any) components need TCBs generated.\\n2. Request sufficient information about those components and any used directives/pipes from the main compiler.\\n3. Generate TCB source text.\\n4. Obtain a `ts.Program` containing the new, generated TCBs.\\n5. Use TypeScript APIs against this program and the TCBs to answer the query.\\n\\nTo enable the most flexibility for integrating the template type checking engine into various compilation workflows, steps 2 and 4 are abstracted behind interfaces.\\n\", 'Step 2: template information': '\\nTo answer most queries, the `TemplateTypeChecker` will require the TCB for a specific component. If not already generated, this involves generating a TCB for that component, and incorporating that TCB somehow into a new `ts.Program`.\\n\\nEach source file in the user\\'s program has a corresponding synthetic \"typecheck\" file which holds the TCBs for any components it contains. Updating this typecheck file with new contents (a new TCB) has a large fixed cost, regardless of the scope of the textual change to the file. Thus, the `TemplateTypeChecker` will always generate _all_ TCBs for a given input file, instead of just the one it needs. The marginal cost of generating the extra TCBs is extremely low.\\n\\nTo perform this generation, the type checking system first constructs a \"context\" into which template information can be recorded. It then requests (via an interface, the `ProgramTypeCheckAdapter`) that this context be populated with information about any templates present in the input file(s) it needs to process. Once populated, the information in the context can be used to drive TCB generation.\\n\\nThis process is somewhat complicated by the bookkeeping required to track which TCBs have been generated as well as the source mapping information for components within those TCBs.\\n\\nOn the compiler side, this interface drives the `TraitCompiler` to call the `typeCheck()` method of the `ComponentDecoratorHandler` for each decorated component class.\\n', 'Step 4: `ts.Program`s': '\\nThe main output of the TCB generation mechanism is a list of new text contents for various source files. Typically this contains new TCB text for \"typecheck\" source files, but inline operations may require changes to actual user input files.\\n\\nBefore diagnostics can be produced or the `ts.TypeChecker` API can be used to interrogate types within the TCBs, these changes need to be parsed and incorporated into a `ts.Program`.\\n\\nCreating such a `ts.Program` is not the responsibility of the `TemplateTypeChecker`. Instead, this creation is abstracted behind the `TypeCheckingProgramStrategy` interface. A strategy which implements this interface allows the type checking system to request textual changes be applied to the current `ts.Program`, resulting in an updated `ts.Program`.\\n\\nAs a convenience, the type-checking system provides an implementation of this abstraction, the `ReusedProgramStrategy`, which can be used by consumers that manage `ts.Program`s via TypeScript\\'s `ts.createProgram` API. The main compiler uses this strategy to support template type checking.\\n\\n`ts.Program`s can also be created via Language Service APIs, which would require a different strategy implementation.'}\n",

            "Parsed sections: {'JSAction': '\\n> [!CAUTION] This document serves as a technical documentation of an internal\\n> library used within Angular. This is **not** a public API that Angular\\n> provides, avoid using it directly in Angular applications.\\n\\nJSAction is a tiny, low-level event delegation library that decouples the\\nregistration of event listeners from the JavaScript code for the listeners\\nthemselves. This enables capturing user interactions before the application is\\nbootstrapped or hydrated as well as very fine grained lazy loading of event\\nhandling code. It is typically used as a sub-component of a larger framework,\\nrather than as a stand-alone library.\\n', 'How it works': '\\nThe traditional way of adding an event listener is to obtain a reference to the\\nnode and call `.addEventListener` (or use `.onclick`-like properties). However,\\nthis necessarily requires that the code that handles the event has been loaded.\\nThis can introduce a couple problems:\\n\\n1.  Server rendered applications will silently ignore user events that happen\\n    before the app hydrates and registers handlers\\n\\n    ```html\\n    <!-- Let\\'s say this server-rendered page is streamed to the browser -->\\n    <body>\\n      <button id=\"buy_btn\" type=\"button\">Buy now!</button>\\n      ...\\n      <!--\\n      There\\'s a window of time between when the button is rendered and the\\n      script below reaches the client, either because there\\'s a lot of content\\n      streamed in-between, network lag, or the script is asynchronously loaded\\n      via a follow-up network request rather than as part of the main document\\n      content.\\n      ->\\n      ...\\n      <script>\\n        const btn = document.querySelector(\\'#buy_btn\\');\\n        // Until this line is executed, clicking on the button doesn\\'t do\\n        // anything. This can be a frustrating user experience.\\n        btn.addEventListener(\\'click\\', () => app.confirmPurchase());\\n      </script>\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  Applications must eagerly load any possible handler that could be needed to\\n    handle user interactions, even if that handler is never invoked or even\\n    rendered on the page\\n\\n    ```html\\n    // This button is rarely clicked, but the code to show the dialog must be\\n    // loaded for every user\\n    <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"showAdvancedOptionsDialog()\">\\n      Advanced options\\n    </button>\\n\\n    // Non-admins will never see this button, and yet they still have to load\\n    // this handler.\\n    @if (isAdmin) {\\n      <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"showAdminOptionsDialog()\">\\n        Admin options\\n      </button>\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n    It\\'s possible to write these handlers so that they will late-load their\\n    inner logic, but that\\'s a manual, opt-in solution.\\n\\nInstead, JSAction \"registers\" event handlers by storing a map from event type\\nto handler name (which can map to whatever handler function or behavior the\\napplication needs) on a custom HTML `jsaction` attribute.\\n\\n```html\\n<button id=\"buy_btn\" type=\"button\" jsaction=\"click:confirmPurchase\">\\n  Buy now!\\n</button>\\n```\\n\\nA small inline script is added before any application content which registers\\nglobal event handlers for event types that could be delegated. Any events\\ntriggered on the page bubble up to the global handler and are queued until the\\napplication has bootstrapped or hydrated.\\n\\nOnce ready, JSAction can \"replay\" the queued events to the application,\\nproviding the events and their matched handler name. It\\'s up to the user of\\nJSAction what to do with the replayed events. The handler name could be mapped\\nto some eagerly loaded handlers and called right away, or it could be used to\\nlazily load a handler. (Typically JSAction is not used directly, but configured\\nby a framework like Angular or Wiz).\\n\\nFrameworks may continue using JSAction after hydration to take advantage of its\\nevent delegation. This allows handling most if not all events in your\\napplication with just a few global listeners, saving the cost of registering\\na larger amount (potentially thousands) of listeners on individual elements.\\n', '`jsaction` attribute syntax': '\\nThe value of the `jsaction` attribute encodes a mapping from event type to\\nhandler name. The grammar for its syntax in [EBNF\\nformat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) is as\\nfollows:\\n\\n```ebnf\\n; JSAction attribute syntax in ENBF format\\njsaction-attr-value   = binding, { \";\", jsaction-attr-value }\\n\\nbinding               = [ event-type, \":\" ], event-handler\\n\\nevent-type            = { white space characters }, [valid-name], { white space characters }\\nevent-handler         = { white space characters }, [valid-name], { white space characters }\\n\\nvalid-name            = { valid-char }\\n\\nvalid-char            = character - invalid-name-chars\\ninvalid-name-chars    = \":\" | \";\" | \".\"\\n```\\n\\n- Omitting the event type and colon will default the binding to the `click`\\n  event (e.g.`jsaction=\"handleClick;hover:handleHover\"`)\\n- Both the event type and handler name can be the empty string (but make sure\\n  to keep the colon: `jsaction=\"change:;\"`)\\n- The `event-handler` is an arbitrary string that can store metadata needed to\\n  find the handler that handles the event. The user of JSAction can choose to\\n  define the semantics of the handler string however they like.\\n', 'Example': '\\n```html\\n<div jsaction=\"click:handleClick;hover:handleHover\"></div>\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, there are two event bindings:\\n\\n1.  The `click` event is bound to the handler name `handleClick`\\n2.  The `hover` event is bound to the handler name `handleHover`\\n', 'Setup': '', '1. Create the `EventContract`': \"\\nFirst, we need to set up the `EventContract`, which installs the global handlers\\nfor JSAction. The contract can be configured as follows:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport {EventContract} from '@angular/core/primitives/event-dispatch/src/eventcontract';\\nimport {EventContractContainer} from '@angular/core/primitives/event-dispatch/src/event_contract_container';\\n\\n/**\\n * The list of event types that you want JSAction to listen for.

Code size is critical here since this code will be inlined\\nat the top of the page and will block rendering content.\\n\", '2. Embed the `EventContract`': '\\nIn your server rendered application, embed the contract bundle at the top of\\nyour `<body>`, before any other content is rendered. Make sure that the bundle\\nis inlined in a `<script>` tag rather than loaded from a URL, since inlined\\nscripts will block rendering and prevent showing content before JSAction is\\ninstalled.\\n\\n```html\\n<body>\\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\\n    <!-- inline bundled code from above here -->\\n  </script>\\n    <!-- ...page content here... -->\\n</body>\\n```\\n', '3. Bind to events with `jsaction` attributes': '\\nAdd a `jsaction` attribute for every handler in your application that you want\\nto register with JSAction. If you\\'re embedding JSAction into a framework, you\\nwould probably update your event handling APIs to automatically render these\\nattributes for your users.\\n\\n```html\\n<button type=\"button\" jsaction=\"click:handleClick\">Buy now!</button>\\n```\\n', '4. Register your application with JSAction': \"\\nFinally, once your application is bootstrapped and ready to handle events,\\nyou'll need to create a `Dispatcher` and register it with the `EventContract`\\nthat has been queueing events.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport {Dispatcher, registerDispatcher} from '@angular/core/primitives/event-dispatch';\\n\\nfunction handleEvent(eventInfoWrapper) {\\n  // eventInfoWrapper contains all the information about the event\\n  const eventType = eventInfoWrapper.getEventType();\\n  const handlerName = eventInfoWrapper.getAction().name;\\n  const event = eventInfoWrapper.getEvent();\\n\\n  // Your application or framework must now decide how to get and call the\\n  // appropriate handler.\\n  myApp.runHandler(eventType, handlerName, event);\\n}\\n\\nfunction eventReplayer(eventInfoWrappers) {\\n  // The dispatcher uses a separate callback for replaying events to allow\\n  // control over how the events are replayed.

What the\\napplication does to handle the dispatched events is up to you. It can be as\\nsimple as calling methods in a map keyed by handler name, or as complicated as a\\ndynamic lazy loading system to load a handler based on the handler name.\\n\", '5. [optional] Cleanup event contract': \"\\nOptionally, you can clean up and remove the event contract from the app if you\\nplan to replace all jsaction attributes with native event handlers.

            "Parsed sections: {'Angular Signals Implementation': '\\nThis directory contains the code which powers Angular\\'s reactive primitive, an implementation of the \"signal\" concept. A signal is a value which is \"reactive\", meaning it can notify interested consumers when it changes. There are many different implementations of this concept, with different designs for how these notifications are subscribed to and propagated, how cleanup/unsubscription works, how dependencies are tracked, etc. This document describes the algorithm behind our specific implementation of the signal pattern.\\n', 'Conceptual surface': \"\\nAngular Signals are zero-argument functions (`() => T`). When executed, they return the current value of the signal. Executing signals does not trigger side effects, though it may lazily recompute intermediate values (lazy memoization).\\n\\nParticular contexts (such as template expressions) can be _reactive_. In such contexts, executing a signal will return the value, but also register the signal as a dependency of the context in question. The context's owner will then be notified if any of its signal dependencies produces a new value (usually, this results in the re-execution of those expressions to consume the new values).\\n\\nThis context and getter function mechanism allows for signal dependencies of a context to be tracked _automatically_ and _implicitly_. Users do not need to declare arrays of dependencies, nor does the set of dependencies of a particular context need to remain static across executions.\\n\", 'Source signals': '\\n\\n', 'Writable signals: `signal()`': '\\nThe `createSignal()` function produces a specific type of signal that tracks a stored value. In addition to providing a getter function, these signals can be wired up with additional APIs for changing the value of the signal (along with notifying any dependents of the change). These include the `.set` operation for replacing the signal value, and `.update` for deriving a new value. In Angular, these are exposed as functions on the signal getter itself. For example:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst counter = signal(0);\\n\\ncounter.set(2);\\ncounter.update(count => count + 1);\\n```\\n', 'Equality': '\\nThe signal creation function one can, optionally, specify an equality comparator function. The comparator is used to decide whether the new supplied value is the same, or different, as compared to the current signal’s value.\\n\\nIf the equality function determines that 2 values are equal it will:\\n* block update of signal’s value;\\n* skip change propagation.\\n', 'Declarative derived values': '\\n`createComputed()` creates a memoizing signal, which calculates its value from the values of some number of input signals. In Angular this is wrapped into the `computed` constructor:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst counter = signal(0);\\n\\n// Automatically updates when `counter` changes:\\nconst isEven = computed(() => counter() % 2 === 0);\\n```\\n\\nBecause the calculation function used to create the `computed` is executed in a reactive context, any signals read by that calculation will be tracked as dependencies, and the value of the computed signal recalculated whenever any of those dependencies changes.\\n\\nSimilarly to signals, the `computed` can (optionally) specify an equality comparator function. \\n', 'Side effects: `createWatch()`': \"\\nThe signals library provides an operation to watch a reactive function and receive notifications when the dependencies of that function change. This is used within Angular to build `effect()`.\\n\\n`effect()` schedules and runs a side-effectful function inside a reactive context. Signal dependencies of this function are captured, and the side effect is re-executed whenever any of its dependencies produces a new value.\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst counter = signal(0);\\neffect(() => console.log('The counter is:', counter()));\\n// The counter is: 0\\n\\ncounter.set(1);\\n// The counter is: 1\\n```\\n\\nEffects do not execute synchronously with the set (see the section on glitch-free execution below), but are scheduled and resolved by the framework. The exact timing of effects is unspecified.\\n\", 'Producer and Consumer': '\\nInternally, the signals implementation is defined in terms of two abstractions, producers and consumers. Producers represents values which can deliver change notifications, such as the various flavors of `Signal`s. Consumers represents a reactive context which may depend on some number of producers. In other words, producers produce reactivity, and consumers consume it.\\n\\nImplementers of either abstraction define a node object which implements the `ReactiveNode` interface, which models participation in the reactive graph. Any `ReactiveNode` can act in the role of a producer, a consumer, or both, by interacting with the appropriate subset of APIs. For example, `WritableSignal`s implement `ReactiveNode` but only operate against the producer APIs, since `WritableSignal`s don\\'t consume other signal values.\\n\\nSome concepts are both producers _and_ consumers. For example, derived `computed` expressions consume other signals to produce new reactive values.\\n\\nThroughout the rest of this document, \"producer\" and \"consumer\" are used to describe `ReactiveNode`s acting in that capacity.\\n', 'The Dependency Graph': '\\n`ReactiveNode`s are linked together through a dependency graph. This dependency graph is bidirectional, but there are differences in which dependencies are tracked in each direction.\\n\\nConsumers always keep track of the producers they depend on. Producers only track dependencies from consumers which are considered \"live\". A consumer is \"live\" when either:\\n\\n* It sets the `consumerIsAlwaysLive` property of its `ReactiveNode` to `true`, or\\n* It\\'s also a producer which is depended upon by a live consumer.\\n\\nIn that sense, \"liveness\" is a transitive property of consumers.\\n\\nIn practice, effects (including template pseudo-effects) are live consumers, which `computed`s are not inherently live. This means that any `computed` used in an `effect` will be treated as live, but a `computed` not read in any effects will not be.\\n', 'Liveness and memory management': \"\\nThe concept of liveness allows for producer-to-consumer dependency tracking without risking memory leaks.\\n\\nConsider this contrived case of a `signal` and a `computed`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst counter = signal(1);\\n\\nlet double = computed(() => counter() * 2);\\nconsole.log(double()); // 2\\ndouble = null;\\n```\\n\\nIf the dependency graph maintained a hard reference from `counter` to `double`, then `double` would be retained(not garbage collected) even though the user dropped their last reference to the actual signal. But because `double` is not live, the graph doesn't hold a reference from `counter` to `double`, and `double` can be freed when the user drops it.\", 'Non-live consumers and polling': '\\nA consequence of not tracking an edge from `counter` to `double` is that when counter is changed:\\n\\n```typescript\\ncounter.set(2);\\n```\\n\\nNo notification can propagate in the graph from `counter` to `double`, to let the `computed` know that it needs to throw away its memoized value (2) and recompute (producing 4).\\n\\nInstead, when `double()` is read, it polls its producers (which _are_ tracked in the graph) and checks whether any of them report having changed since the last time `double` was calculated. If not, it can safely use its memoized value.\\n', 'With a live consumer': \"\\nIf an `effect` is created:\\n\\n```typescript\\neffect(() => console.log(double()));\\n```\\n\\nThen `double` becomes a live consumer, as it's a dependency of a live consumer (the effect), and the graph will have a hard reference from `counter` to `double` to the effect consumer. There is no risk of memory leaks though, since the effect is referencing `double` directly anyway, and the effect cannot just be dropped and must be manually destroyed (which would cause `double` to no longer be live). That is, there is no way for a reference from a producer to a live consumer to exist in the graph _without_ the consumer also referencing the producer outside of the graph.`\\n\", '\"Glitch Free\" property': '\\nConsider the following setup:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst counter = signal(0);\\nconst evenOrOdd = computed(() => counter() % 2 === 0 ? \\'even\\' : \\'odd\\');\\neffect(() => console.log(counter() + \\' is \\' + evenOrOdd()));\\n\\ncounter.set(1);\\n```\\n\\nWhen the effect is first created, it will print \"0 is even\", as expected, and record that both `counter` and `evenOrOdd` are dependencies of the logging effect.\\n\\nWhen `counter` is set to `1`, this invalidates both `evenOrOdd` and the logging effect. If `counter.set()` iterated through the dependencies of `counter` and triggered the logging effect first, before notifying `evenOrOdd` of the change, however, we might observe the inconsistent logging statement \"1 is even\". Eventually `evenOrOdd` would be notified, which would trigger the logging effect again, logging the correct statement \"1 is odd\".\\n\\nIn this situation, the logging effect\\'s observation of the inconsistent state \"1 is even\" is known as a _glitch_. A major goal of reactive system design is to prevent such intermediate states from ever being observed, and ensure _glitch-free execution_.\\n', 'Push/Pull Algorithm': '\\nAngular Signals guarantees glitch-free execution by separating updates to the `ReactiveNode` graph into two phases. The first phase is performed eagerly when a producer value is changed. This change notification is propagated through the graph, notifying live consumers which depend on the producer of the potential update. Some of these consumers may be derived values and thus also producers, which invalidate their cached values and then continue the propagation of the change notification to their own live consumers, and so on. Ultimately this notification reaches effects, which schedule themselves for re-execution.\\n\\nCrucially, during this first phase, no side effects are run, and no recomputation of intermediate or derived values is performed, only invalidation of cached values. This allows the change notification to reach all affected nodes in the graph without the possibility of observing intermediate or glitchy states.\\n\\nOnce this change propagation has completed (synchronously), the second phase can begin. In this second phase, signal values may be read by the application or framework, triggering recomputation of any needed derived values which were previously invalidated.\\n\\nWe refer to this as the \"push/pull\" algorithm: \"dirtiness\" is eagerly _pushed_ through the graph when a source signal is changed, but recalculation is performed lazily, only when values are _pulled_ by reading their signals.\\n', 'Dynamic Dependency Tracking': \"\\nWhen a reactive context operation (for example, an `effect`'s side effect function) is executed, the signals that it reads are tracked as dependencies. However, this may not be the same set of signals from one execution to the next. For example, this computed signal:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst dynamic = computed(() => useA() ? dataA() : dataB());\\n```\\n\\nreads either `dataA` or `dataB` depending on the value of the `useA` signal. At any given point, it will have a dependency set of either `[useA, dataA]` or `[useA, dataB]`, and it can never depend on `dataA` and `dataB` at the same time.\\n\\nThe potential dependencies of a reactive context are unbounded. Signals may be stored in variables or other data structures and swapped out with other signals from time to time. Thus, the signals implementation must deal with potential changes in the set of dependencies of a consumer on each execution.\\n\\nDependencies of a computation are tracked in an array. When the computation is rerun, a pointer into that array is initialized to the index `0`, and each dependency read is compared against the dependency from the previous run at the pointer's current location. If there's a mismatch, then the dependencies have changed since the last run, and the old dependency can be dropped and replaced with the new one. At the end of the run, any remaining unmatched dependencies can be dropped.\\n\", 'Equality Semantics': '\\nProducers may lazily produce their value (such as a `computed` which only recalculates its value when pulled). However, a producer may also choose to apply an equality check to the values that it produces, and determine that the newly computed value is \"equal\" semantically to the previous. In this case, consumers which depend on that value should not be re-executed. For example, the following effect:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst counter = signal(0);\\nconst isEven = computed(() => counter() % 2 === 0);\\neffect(() => console.log(isEven() ? \\'even!\\' : \\'odd!\\'));\\n```\\n\\nshould run if `counter` is updated to `1` as the value of `isEven` switches from `true` to `false`. But if `counter` is then set to `3`, `isEven` will recompute the same value: `false`. Therefore the logging effect should not run.\\n\\nThis is a tricky property to guarantee in our implementation because values are not recomputed during the push phase of change propagation. `isEven` is invalidated when `counter` is changed, which causes the logging `effect` to also be invalidated and scheduled. Naively, `isEven` wouldn\\'t be recomputed until the logging effect actually runs and attempts to read its value, which is too late to notice that it didn\\'t need to run at all.\\n', 'Value Versioning': '\\nTo solve this problem, our implementation uses a similar technique to tracking dependency staleness. Producers track a monotonically increasing `version`, representing the semantic identity of their value. `version` is incremented when the producer produces a semantically new value. The current `version` of each dependency (producer) is saved as part of the tracked dependencies of a consumer.\\n\\nBefore consumers trigger their reactive operations (e.g. the side effect function for `effect`s, or the recomputation for `computed`s), they poll their dependencies and ask for `version` to be refreshed if needed. For a `computed`, this will trigger recomputation of the value and the subsequent equality check, if the value is stale (which makes this polling a recursive process as the `computed` is also a consumer which will poll its own producers). If this recomputation produces a semantically changed value, `version` is incremented.\\n\\nThe consumer can then compare the `version` of the new value with its last read version to determine if that particular dependency really did change. By doing this for all producers the consumer can determine that, if all `version`s match, that no _actual_ change to any dependency has occurred, and it can skip reacting to that change (e.g. skip running the side effect function).\\n', '`Watch` primitive': \"\\n`Watch` is a primitive used to build different types of effects. `Watch`es are consumers that run side-effectful functions in their reactive context, but where the scheduling of the side effect is delegated to the implementor. The `Watch` will call this scheduling operation when it receives a notification that it's stale.\\n\"}\n",

You can find the values for `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` in `/.circleci/env.sh`. `SAUCE_TUNNEL_IDENTIFIER` can be set to any unique value.\\n\\nIf you are having trouble running Saucelabs tests locally you can contact [Joey Perrott](https://github.com/josephperrott) or [Paul Gschwendtner](https://github.com/devversion) for support.\\n\\n2. Once you have your environment variables set up, run the setup task in the root of the repo:\\n\\n``` bash\\nyarn bazel run //tools/saucelabs-daemon/background-service -- <number_of_browsers>\\n```\\n\\nThis will start a daemon process that will connect to Saucelabs and provision browsers\\nonce you start running your first test target.\\n\\n3. In another terminal, you can run a particular test target through SauceLabs by suffixing the target name with \"_saucelabs\".\\n\\nFor example, `packages/core/test:test_web` becomes `packages/core/test:test_web_saucelabs`.\\n\\n```\\nyarn bazel test //packages/core/test:test_web_saucelabs\\n```\\n', 'Additional test features': '\\nTo see the test output while the tests are running (as these are long tests), add the `--test_output=streamed` option. \\nNote, this option will also prevent bazel from using the test cache and will force the test to run.\\n\\nFor running all Saucelabs tests in the project, `bazel query` is used to gather up all karma Saucelabs test labels because they are otherwise hidden by the `manual` tag.\\n\\nRunning all karma tests in Saucelabs:\\n\\n``` bash\\n./scripts/test/run-saucelabs-tests.sh\\n```\\n\\nto override the default number of parallel browsers to acquire on Saucelabs you\\npass an optional configuration parameters.

Subscribing to a job\\nreturns messages from the point where the job is at.\\n', 'Argument, Input, Output and Channels': '\\nA job receives a single argument when scheduled and can also listen to an input channel. It can\\nemit multiple outputs, and can also provide multiple output channels that emit asynchronous JSON\\nmessages, which can be typed.\\n\\nThe I/O model is like that of an executable, where the argument corresponds to arguments on the\\ncommand line, the input channel to STDIN, the output channel to STDOUT, and the channels\\nwould be additional output streams.\\n', 'LifeCycle': '\\nA `Job` goes through multiple LifeCycle messages before its completion;\\n\\n1. `JobState.Queued`.

The job has ended and is done running. This is handled by the job itself (or\\n   `createJobHandler()`).\\n1. `JobState.Errored`. A unrecoverable error happened.\\n\\nEach state (except `Queued`) corresponds to a `JobOutboundMessage` on the `outboundBus` observable\\nthat triggers the state change. The `Scheduler` emits the `Ready` and `Errored` messages; the job\\nimplementation should not emit them, and if it does they are filtered out. You can listen for\\nthese messages or use the corresponding state member.\\n\\nThe job implementation should emit the `Start` and `End` messages when it is starting the job logic\\nitself. Only the first `Start` and `End` messages will be forwarded. Any more will be filtered out.\\n\\nThe `Queued` state is set as the job is scheduled, so there is no need to listen for the message.\\n', '`Job<OutputType>` Object': '\\nThe `Job` object that is returned when you schedule a job provides access to the job\\'s status and\\nutilities for tracking and modifying the job.\\n\\n1. `id`.

A [reference CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/main/packages/angular_devkit/schematics_cli/bin/schematics.ts) is available on this repository, and is published on NPM at [@angular-devkit/schematics-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli). This document explains the library usage and the tooling API, but does not go into the tool implementation itself.\\n\\nThe tooling is responsible for the following tasks:\\n\\n1. Create the Schematic Engine, and pass in a Collection and Schematic loader.\\n1. Understand and respect the Schematics metadata and dependencies between collections. Schematics can refer to dependencies, and it's the responsibility of the tool to honor those dependencies. The reference CLI uses NPM packages for its collections.\\n1. Create the Options object. Options can be anything, but the schematics can specify a JSON Schema that should be respected. The reference CLI, for example, parses the arguments as a JSON object and validates it with the Schema specified by the collection.\\n1. Schematics provides some JSON Schema formats for validation that tooling should add. These validate paths, html selectors and app names. Please check the reference CLI for how these can be added.\\n1. Call the schematics with the original Tree. The tree should represent the initial state of the filesystem. The reference CLI uses the current directory for this.\\n1. Create a Sink and commit the result of the schematics to the Sink. Many sinks are provided by the library; FileSystemSink and DryRunSink are examples.\\n1. Output any logs propagated by the library, including debugging information.\\n\\nThe tooling API is composed of the following pieces:\\n\", 'Engine': '\\nThe `SchematicEngine` is responsible for loading and constructing `Collection`s and `Schematics`. When creating an engine, the tooling provides an `EngineHost` interface that understands how to create a `CollectionDescription` from a name, and how to create a `SchematicDescription`.\\n', 'Schematics (Generators)': '\\nSchematics are generators and part of a `Collection`.\\n', 'Collection': '\\nA Collection is defined by a `collection.json` file (in the reference CLI). This JSON defines the following properties:\\n\\n| Prop Name   | Type     | Description                 |\\n| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------- |\\n| **name**    | `string` | The name of the collection. |\\n| **version** | `string` | Unused field.               |\\n', 'Schematic': '', 'Operators, Sources and Rules': '\\nA `Source` is a generator of a `Tree`; it creates an entirely new root tree from nothing. A `Rule` is a transformation from one `Tree` to another. A `Schematic` (at the root) is a `Rule` that is normally applied on the filesystem.\\n', 'Operators': '\\n`FileOperator`s apply changes to a single `FileEntry` and return a new `FileEntry`.

This file will configure the development environment including the necessary components.\\n\\nHere\\'s a basic setup based on the provided context:\\n\\n1. A folder structure that includes:\\n   - `README.md`\\n   - `package.json`\\n   - A new `.devcontainer` folder containing `devcontainer.json`\\n\\n2. The `devcontainer.json` file typically includes details about the development environment, such as the Docker image to use, VS Code extensions, and any post-create commands.\\n\\nHere is a JSON configuration for the dev container:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"My Dev Container\",\\n  \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-14\",\\n  \"runArgs\": [\"--init\"],\\n  \"settings\": {\\n    \"terminal.integrated.shell.linux\": \"/bin/bash\"\\n  },\\n  \"postCreateCommand\": \"npm install\",\\n  \"customizations\": {\\n    \"vscode\": {\\n      \"extensions\": [\\n        \"dbaeumer.vscode-eslint\",\\n        \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"remoteUser\": \"node\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example:\\n\\n- `name`: Name of the dev container.\\n- `image`: Uses a predefined Node.js development container image from Microsoft.\\n- `runArgs`: Additional arguments to pass when running the container (`--init` ensures proper process handling inside Docker).\\n- `settings`: Any VS Code-specific settings (here we set the shell to bash).\\n- `postCreateCommand`: Command to run after the container is created and started (here we run `npm install` to install dependencies from `package.json`).\\n- `customizations`: Specifies VS Code extensions to be installed automatically in the dev container.\\n- `remoteUser`: Sets the default user inside the container to `node` (a user available in the referenced image).\\n\\nMake sure to create the `.devcontainer` folder and place the above configuration into a `devcontainer.json` file within it. Your overall project structure should look something like this:\\n\\n```\\nmy-project\\n│\\n├── README.md\\n├── package.json\\n└── .devcontainer\\n    └── devcontainer.json\\n```\\n\\nThis setup assumes you use Visual Studio Code with the Remote - Containers extension to open and interact with your dev container.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None), content_filter_results={'hate': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'self_harm': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'sexual': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'violence': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}})], created=1719646631, model='gpt-4o-2024-05-13', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_abc28019ad', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=500, prompt_tokens=60, total_tokens=560), prompt_filter_results=[{'prompt_index': 0, 'content_filter_results': {'hate': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'self_harm': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'sexual': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'violence': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}}}])\n",
