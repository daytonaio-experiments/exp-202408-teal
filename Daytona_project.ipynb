This file will configure the development environment including the necessary components.\\n\\nHere\\'s a basic setup based on the provided context:\\n\\n1. A folder structure that includes:\\n   - `README.md`\\n   - `package.json`\\n   - A new `.devcontainer` folder containing `devcontainer.json`\\n\\n2. The `devcontainer.json` file typically includes details about the development environment, such as the Docker image to use, VS Code extensions, and any post-create commands.\\n\\nHere is a JSON configuration for the dev container:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"My Dev Container\",\\n  \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-14\",\\n  \"runArgs\": [\"--init\"],\\n  \"settings\": {\\n    \"terminal.integrated.shell.linux\": \"/bin/bash\"\\n  },\\n  \"postCreateCommand\": \"npm install\",\\n  \"customizations\": {\\n    \"vscode\": {\\n      \"extensions\": [\\n        \"dbaeumer.vscode-eslint\",\\n        \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"remoteUser\": \"node\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example:\\n\\n- `name`: Name of the dev container.\\n- `image`: Uses a predefined Node.js development container image from Microsoft.\\n- `runArgs`: Additional arguments to pass when running the container (`--init` ensures proper process handling inside Docker).\\n- `settings`: Any VS Code-specific settings (here we set the shell to bash).\\n- `postCreateCommand`: Command to run after the container is created and started (here we run `npm install` to install dependencies from `package.json`).\\n- `customizations`: Specifies VS Code extensions to be installed automatically in the dev container.\\n- `remoteUser`: Sets the default user inside the container to `node` (a user available in the referenced image).\\n\\nMake sure to create the `.devcontainer` folder and place the above configuration into a `devcontainer.json` file within it. Your overall project structure should look something like this:\\n\\n```\\nmy-project\\n│\\n├── README.md\\n├── package.json\\n└── .devcontainer\\n    └── devcontainer.json\\n```\\n\\nThis setup assumes you use Visual Studio Code with the Remote - Containers extension to open and interact with your dev container.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None), content_filter_results={'hate': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'self_harm': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'sexual': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'violence': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}})], created=1719646631, model='gpt-4o-2024-05-13', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_abc28019ad', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=500, prompt_tokens=60, total_tokens=560), prompt_filter_results=[{'prompt_index': 0, 'content_filter_results': {'hate': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'self_harm': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'sexual': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}, 'violence': {'filtered': False, 'severity': 'safe'}}}])\n",
