## Instructions for Running the Project:

This project is developed in Jupyter Notebook, which supports code formatting in blocks. Each block in the notebook is numbered for easy identification.

To run the project, execute all blocks sequentially from block number 1 to block number 15.

Regarding your input, it will only be required in block number 14. You can provide input such as the environment name (e.g., Angular) or a full GitHub link at that stage.
